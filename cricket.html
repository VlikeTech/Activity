<h1 class="cricket">All About Cricket</h1>
<p id="cricket-paragraph" class="cricket"><strong>Cricket</strong> is a popular bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on an oval or circular field. The objective is for one team, the batting side, to score as many runs as possible while the other team, the fielding side, tries to get the batters out and restrict the score.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-gameplay">Gameplay</a></strong>:<br> Two batsmen from the batting team are on the pitch, one facing the bowler and the other waiting at the non-striker's end. A bowler from the fielding team bowls the ball toward the batsman, who tries to hit it and score runs by running between the two wickets.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-runs">Scoring runs</a></strong>:<br>
If the batsman and their partner switch ends, they score a single run.<br>
Hitting the ball to the boundary results in four runs, while clearing the boundary rope without it touching the ground is worth six runs.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-out">Dismissing a batsman</a></strong>:<br> Common ways a batsman can be out (or "dismissed") include:<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-bowled">Bowled</a></strong>:<br> The bowler knocks over the wicket behind the batsman with the ball.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-caught">Caught</a></strong>:<br> A fielder catches the ball after it has been hit by the bat, but before it touches the ground.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-lbw">Leg Before Wicket (LBW)</a></strong>:<br> The ball hits the batsman's leg in front of the wicket in a way that would have otherwise bowled them.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-run-out">Run-Out</a></strong>:<br> The fielding team hits the wicket with the ball while the batsmen are attempting to run between them.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-format">Match formats</a></strong>:<br>
There are three main formats for cricket matches, each with a different duration and pace:<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-test">Test Match</a></strong>:<br> This is the longest and most traditional format, lasting up to five days. Each team has two innings (turns at batting).<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-one-day">One-Day International (ODI)</a></strong>:<br> A shorter version of the game where each team gets a single innings with a limit of 50 overs (an over consists of six balls bowled). A match typically lasts seven to eight hours.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-t20">Twenty20 (T20)</a></strong>:<br> This is the fastest and most modern format, with each team batting for only 20 overs. A match usually lasts around three to four hours.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-field-equipment">Field and equipment</a></strong>:<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-field">The field</a></strong>:<br> A cricket match is played on a large oval or circular grass field.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-pitch">The pitch</a></strong>:<br> At the center of the field is a rectangular strip called the pitch, which is 22 yards (about 20 meters) long.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-wicket">The wickets</a></strong>:<br> Placed at each end of the pitch are wickets, consisting of three wooden stumps topped with two small wooden pieces called bails.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-equipment">Equipment</a></strong>:<br> Essential equipment includes:<br>
A bat made of high-grade willow.
A hard leather-stitched ball with a cork core.
Protective gear for the batsmen and wicketkeeper, including helmets, gloves, and pads.<br><br>

<p id="cricket-gameplay" class="cricket"><strong>Gameplay</strong> <br>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on a field with a central 22-yard pitch. Teams take turns batting and fielding, with the objective for the batting team being to score runs and the fielding team to dismiss the batters. The game is divided into sections called "innings," and the rules vary significantly depending on the match format. <br>
The field and players:<br>
The pitch:<br> A rectangular strip at the center of the field, where the primary action takes place.<br>
The wickets:<br> Composed of three stumps topped with two small wooden bails, one wicket stands at each end of the pitch.<br>
The teams: <br>Each of the two teams has 11 players.<br>
Fielding Team:<br> All 11 players are on the field. This includes a bowler, a wicket-keeper (similar to a catcher in baseball), and nine other fielders.<br>
Batting Team:<br> Only two players, the batsmen, are on the field at any one time, one at each wicket. <br>
Core gameplay sequence:<br>
Coin Toss:<br> The game begins with a coin toss, and the winning captain chooses whether to bat or field first.<br>
Batting and Fielding: <br>The fielding team's bowler delivers the ball toward the opposite wicket. The batsman tries to hit the ball with their bat and score runs.<br>
End of Innings: <br>The first innings concludes when either 10 of the 11 batters have been dismissed, or a predetermined number of overs (sets of six deliveries) have been bowled.<br>
Role Swap: <br>The teams switch roles. The second team to bat then tries to beat the first team's score. The team with the most runs wins.<br>
How to score runs:<br>
Running:<br> After the striker hits the ball, the two batters can run to opposite ends of the pitch and switch places. Each successful exchange counts as one run.<br>
Boundaries:<br> If the batter hits the ball to the edge of the field (the boundary), they automatically score runs.<br>
Six runs:<br> Awarded if the ball crosses the boundary without bouncing.<br>
Four runs:<br> Awarded if the ball bounces before crossing the boundary.<br>
Extras:<br> The batting team can also receive extra runs due to bowling errors, such as a "wide" (a delivery too far from the batter) or a "no-ball" (an illegal delivery). <br>
How batters get "out" (dismissed):<br>
The fielding team can get a batter out in several ways, including: <br>
Bowled:<br> The bowler hits the wicket with the ball, dislodging the bails.<br>
Caught:<br> The batter hits the ball into the air, and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground.<br>
Leg Before Wicket (LBW):<br> The ball strikes the batter's leg when it would have otherwise hit the wicket.<br>
Run Out:<br> A fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the batter is attempting to run and is still out of their safe zone (the crease).<br>
Stumped: <br>The wicket-keeper breaks the wicket with the ball while the batter is out of their crease and not attempting a run. <br>
Main formats of play:<br>
The rules can change depending on the match format, which affects the pace and duration of the game. <br>
Test Cricket:<br> The traditional, longest format, played over five days with up to four innings (two per team) and no limit on overs.<br>
One-Day International (ODI):<br> A faster version where each team has a single innings with a maximum of 50 overs.<br>
Twenty20 (T20):<br> The fastest and most dynamic format, where each team plays a single innings limited to 20 overs. A match typically lasts about three hours.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-runs" class="cricket"><strong>Runs</strong><br>In cricket, runs are the units of scoring, and the team with the most runs wins the match. Runs are scored primarily by batsmen hitting the ball and running between the wickets, but they can also be earned by hitting boundaries or from fielding errors by the opposing team.<br>
Scoring runs with a bat:<br>
Running between the wickets:<br> A batsman scores a run by hitting the ball and safely running to the opposite end of the pitch while their batting partner does the same. They can run multiple times on a single hit if the fielders are slow to retrieve the ball. One run is awarded for each successful exchange.<br>
Boundaries:<br> The batsman can also earn runs by hitting the ball to or over the edge of the playing field, called the boundary.<br>
Four runs:<br> Awarded when the ball is hit by the bat and reaches the boundary after bouncing.<br>
Six runs:<br> Awarded when the ball is hit and clears the boundary rope on the fly, without bouncing.<br>
Overthrows: <br>These are runs scored when a fielder throws the ball and misses the wicket, allowing the batsmen to run additional times. The runs from the overthrow are added to any runs the batsmen have already completed. For instance, a hit where the batsmen run for three runs, followed by a four-run overthrow, results in a total of seven runs. <br>
Scoring runs from extras:<br>
Extras are runs that are added to the batting team's total but are not credited to any individual batsman. They are typically given for infractions or errors by the fielding team. <br>
Wide:<br> An extra run is awarded for an illegal delivery that is bowled too far from the batter to be hit with a normal stroke. An extra ball must also be rebowled.<br>
No-ball:<br> An extra run is awarded for an illegal delivery, most commonly when the bowler oversteps the bowling crease. The batting team also gets to face an additional ball.<br>
Bye: <br>If a batter doesn't hit the ball with the bat and the ball passes the wicketkeeper, the batsmen can run. These runs are added to the team's score as "byes". If the ball travels to the boundary without being touched, four byes are awarded.<br>
Leg-bye:<br> If the ball hits the batter's body and they still run, the runs are recorded as "leg-byes." This applies only if the batter attempted to hit the ball or avoid being hit.<br>
Penalty runs:<br> Five penalty runs can be awarded to the batting team for various infractions, such as a fielder illegally tampering with the ball or the ball hitting a fielding helmet left on the ground. <br>
How to read a cricket score:<br>
A cricket score is most often displayed as Runs/Wickets (Overs), for example, 156/3 (23.4). <br>
Runs: <br>The number before the slash (156) is the total number of runs the batting team has scored.<br>
Wickets:<br> The number after the slash (3) indicates the number of batsmen that have been dismissed (gotten "out"). A team's innings ends when ten wickets have fallen.<br>
Overs:<br> The number in parentheses (23.4) shows the number of overs that have been bowled. An over consists of six legal deliveries, so 23.4 means 23 completed overs and 4 balls bowled in the current over.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-out" class="cricket"><strong>Out</strong><br>In cricket, dismissing a batsman ends their turn at bat and is known as taking a wicket. The eleven official ways to dismiss a batsman are categorized as common or rare. <br>
Common methods of dismissal:<br>
These are the most frequent ways a batsman is dismissed in top-level cricket. <br>
Bowled:<br> The bowler's delivery hits and knocks a bail off the stumps. This can happen directly or after the ball deflects off the bat or the batsman's body.<br>
Caught:<br> The batsman hits the ball with their bat (or glove holding the bat) and a fielder catches it cleanly before it touches the ground. If the wicketkeeper takes the catch, it is known as "caught behind." If the bowler takes the catch, it is called "caught and bowled".<br>
Leg Before Wicket (LBW):<br> The ball hits the batsman's body, preventing it from hitting the stumps. An LBW dismissal can be given if, in the umpire's judgment, the ball would have gone on to hit the wicket.<br>
Run Out:<br> A fielder hits the stumps with the ball before a batsman has completed a run and grounded their bat or body behind the popping crease. This can happen to either the striker or non-striker.<br>
Stumped:<br> The wicketkeeper puts down the wicket with the ball after the batsman has moved out of their crease to play a shot and missed the ball. This is a specialized type of run out where the ball is not in flight when the wicket is broken. <br>
Rare methods of dismissal:<br>
These dismissals are much less common and happen under specific circumstances. <br>
Hit Wicket:<br> A batsman is out if they accidentally dislodge a bail with their bat or body while preparing to face or play a shot, or while setting off for a run.<br>
Timed Out:<br> A new batsman is dismissed if they take more than three minutes to get to the crease and be ready to face the next delivery. Angelo Mathews of Sri Lanka was the first batsman to be given out "timed out" in an international match in 2023.<br>
Obstructing the Field:<br> The batsman is out if they willfully obstruct or distract the fielding team by word or action. This law includes what was formerly a separate dismissal called "Handled the ball".<br>
Hit the Ball Twice:<br> The striker is out if they intentionally hit the ball twice, unless the second touch is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps.<br>
Retired Out:<br> A batsman can be given out if they leave the field during their innings without the consent of the umpire and the opposing captain. A batsman who retires due to illness or injury is considered "retired not out" and can potentially return to bat later.<br> <a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-bowled" class="cricket"><strong>Bowled</strong><br>In cricket, "bowled out" means a batting team's innings has ended because all but one of their players have been dismissed. Since two batters must always be on the field, the innings concludes when the tenth batter is out. <br>
The "bowled" dismissal:<br>
"Bowled" is also a specific type of dismissal where the bowler hits the stumps with the ball and dislodges the bails. A batter can be out "bowled" if: <br>
The bowler's delivery hits the stumps directly.<br>
The ball deflects off the batter's bat or body and then hits the stumps. <br>
How a team is bowled out:<br>
To end the batting side's innings and get them "all out" or "bowled out," the fielding team must dismiss 10 of the 11 batters. Batters can be dismissed in several ways, with "bowled" being one of them: <br>
Caught:<br> A fielder catches the ball after the batter has hit it but before it touches the ground.<br>
Leg Before Wicket (LBW):<br> The ball hits the batter's body (usually the leg) when it would have otherwise gone on to hit the stumps.<br>
Run Out:<br> A batter is unable to make it back to their crease before a fielder hits the stumps with the ball.<br>
Stumped: <br>The wicketkeeper dislodges the bails when the batter is out of the crease after missing the ball.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="cricket-caught" class="cricket"><strong>Caught</strong><br>In cricket, a batter is "caught out" if they hit the ball with their bat (or a gloved hand holding the bat), and a fielder catches the ball before it touches the ground. This is the most common way for a batter to be dismissed. <br>
How a caught dismissal works:<br>
The hit:<br> The batter must strike the ball with their bat, or with their hand or glove while holding the bat.<br>
The catch: <br>A member of the fielding team which includes the bowler, fielders, and wicketkeeper must catch the ball cleanly before it bounces on the ground.<br>
A "fair catch" requires:<br>
The fielder to have complete control of the ball.<br>
No part of the fielder's body or equipment to touch or be grounded beyond the boundary line while the catch is being made.<br>
The catch to be made off a legitimate delivery, not a "no-ball".<br>
Exceptions and clarifications:<br>
Off a deflection:<br> The ball can deflect off a batter's pad onto the bat and still be a fair catch.<br>
Dropped and caught: <br>If a fielder drops the ball but another fielder catches it, the batter is still out, provided the ball has not touched the ground. <br>
Types of caught dismissals:<br>
Caught behind:<br> The wicketkeeper catches the ball after the batter hits it.<br>
Caught and bowled:<br> The bowler catches a ball that the batter has hit.<br>
Caught by a fielder:<br> Any other fielder on the pitch catches the ball.<br>
What happens after a "caught" dismissal:<br>
The runs are void:<br> Any runs the batters may have completed during that delivery are not counted.<br>
The batter is out:<br> The dismissed batter must leave the field and is replaced by the next batter on the team.<br>
Wicket and credit: <br>The bowler is credited with the wicket, and the catching fielder is also noted in the scorebook.<br>
What if it is also bowled? If a batter hits the ball onto their own stumps (being bowled) and a fielder catches it, the "bowled" dismissal takes precedence. <br>
Niche rules and scenarios:<br>
No catch off a helmet:<br> If the ball lodges in a fielder's protective helmet, it is not considered a fair catch.<br>
Not out on a no-ball:<br> If the bowler delivers a "no-ball" and the batter is caught, they are not out.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="cricket-lbw" class="cricket"><strong>LBW</strong><br>Leg Before Wicket (LBW) is a method of dismissing a batter in cricket. The dismissal occurs when the batter blocks a bowled ball with their body, preventing it from hitting the wicket, under a specific set of rules. While the full rules are intricate, here's a simplified explanation. <br>
The basic rules:<br>
For a batter to be given out LBW, all of the following conditions must be met:<br>
The ball must be a legal delivery:<br> It cannot be a no-ball.<br>
Initial contact is with the body:<br> The ball must strike the batter's body (most commonly the leg or pad) before it hits their bat or a gloved hand holding the bat.<br>
The ball would have hit the stumps: <br>In the umpire's judgment, the ball would have gone on to hit the wickets had it not been intercepted.<br>
The fielding side must appeal:<br> The fielding team has to ask the umpire for a decision, typically by shouting "How's that?". <br>
Additional complexities:<br>
The decision is complicated by where the ball bounces, where it hits the batter, and whether the batter was playing a shot. <br>
Where the ball pitches (bounces):<br>
Pitches in line or outside off-stump: If the ball pitches in line with the stumps or on the off-side (the side the batter faces), the batter can be given out LBW.<br>
Pitches outside leg-stump: <br>If the ball pitches on the leg-side (behind the batter), it can never be an LBW dismissal, even if it was clearly going on to hit the stumps. <br>
Where the ball impacts the batter's body:<br>
Impact is in line with the stumps:<br> If the ball hits the batter's body in a direct line between the wickets, the batter can be given out, regardless of whether they played a shot.<br>
Impact is outside the off-stump:<br> The batter can still be given out LBW if the impact was outside the off-stump, but only if they made no genuine attempt to play a shot. If they did try to hit the ball, they cannot be given out. <br>
The role of technology:<br>
LBW decisions, which were historically a source of contention due to the umpire's subjective judgment, are now heavily influenced by technology. <br>
Decision Review System (DRS):<br> In professional cricket, teams can challenge an umpire's LBW decision.<br>
Hawk-Eye:<br> This ball-tracking technology shows the predicted trajectory of the ball and whether it would have hit the stumps.<br>
Umpire's Call:<br> The DRS includes an "Umpire's Call" element to account for small margins of error. If Hawk-Eye shows the ball is just clipping the stumps, the original on-field decision stands.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-run-out" class="cricket"><strong>Run-out</strong><br>A run-out is a method of dismissing a batter in cricket where a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the batter is not safely in their ground (crease). It can occur whether the batters are attempting a run or not. <br>
Key elements of a run-out:<br>
The popping crease:<br> A white line marked on the pitch in front of each set of stumps. For a batter to be safe, they must have some part of their person or bat grounded behind this line.<br>
The broken wicket:<br> The wicket is "broken" when one or both bails are removed from the stumps, or a stump is removed from the ground. The fielder can do this in two main ways:<br>
By hitting the stumps directly with the ball.<br>
By hitting the stumps with the ball held in their hand(s).<br>
Ball in play: <br>A run-out can only happen while the ball is "in play" and not "dead".<br>
The appeal:<br> The fielding side must appeal to the umpire by saying "How's that?" for the dismissal to be given. <br>
Common run-out scenarios:<br>
Attempting a run: <br>This is the most common scenario. The batters hit the ball and try to score runs by running from one end of the pitch to the other. If a fielder collects the ball and breaks the wicket before a batter reaches the safety of their crease, that batter is out.<br>
A "Mankad" dismissal:<br> The non-striking batter often leaves their crease early to get a head start on a run. A bowler can run them out by stopping their bowling action and breaking the stumps at their end before releasing the ball. This was previously considered against the "spirit of the game" but is now officially part of the run-out law.<br>
Out of the crease:<br> A batter can be run out even when not attempting a run. For example, if a batter takes a few steps out of their crease after playing a shot, an alert fielder can quickly collect the ball and break the wicket. <br>
Key distinction: <br>Run-out vs. stumping:<br>
While both involve the wicket being broken, the key difference is who performs the action. A run-out is performed by any fielder, whereas a stumping is performed by the wicket-keeper and only occurs when a batter is out of their crease and has missed the ball. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-format" class="cricket"><strong>Formats</strong><br>In professional cricket, there are three main match formats, each with distinct rules, length, and strategy: Test, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 (T20). Shorter, regional formats like The Hundred and T10 also exist. <br>
Test cricket:<br>
The oldest and longest form of the game, Test cricket is considered the ultimate test of a team's skill, stamina, and resilience.<br>
Duration: <br>Up to five days, with each day having three sessions of play.<br>
Innings:<br> Each team has two innings to bat and bowl. The aim is to win by bowling the opposing team out in its final innings while having more runs.<br>
Attire:<br> Players traditionally wear white clothing, and a red ball is used.<br>
Results:<br> A team can win, or the match can end in a draw if a result is not reached in the allotted time.<br>
Major Tournament:<br> The ICC World Test Championship is the pinnacle tournament for this format. <br>
One Day International (ODI):<br>
ODIs are a limited-overs format that balances the tradition of Test cricket with the fast pace of T20s. <br>
Duration:<br> The match is completed in a single day, typically lasting about 7 to 8 hours.<br>
Overs:<br> Each team bats for a single innings limited to 50 overs.<br>
Attire:<br> Teams wear colored uniforms, and a white ball is used for better visibility.<br>
Play style: <br>The format requires a mix of aggressive batting and stable defense. Teams often employ strategic "powerplays" with fielding restrictions to maximize scoring.<br>
Major Tournament: <br>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the premier event for ODIs. <br>
Twenty20 (T20):<br>
T20 is the most modern and fastest-paced version of the game, designed for action-packed excitement over a shorter period. <br>
Duration:<br> Matches usually last around three hours.<br>
Overs:<br> Each team bats for a single innings limited to 20 overs.<br>
Play style:<br> Scoring is rapid, with an emphasis on power-hitting and boundaries. Bowlers use a variety of strategies to control the scoring rate.<br>
Results: <br>If a match is tied, a "Super Over" (a one-over mini-match) is played to determine the winner.<br>
Major Tournaments:<br> The ICC T20 World Cup and popular domestic leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Australia's Big Bash League (BBL) are played in this format. <br>
Other formats:<br>
In addition to the primary formats, several other types of cricket exist, including regional and unofficial variations:<br>
First-class cricket:<br> Any match played over three or more days that meets certain high standards, with Test cricket being the highest form of first-class cricket.<br>
The Hundred:<br> A domestic format in the UK where each innings is limited to 100 balls, rather than a specific number of overs.<br>
T10:<br> A rapid format with only 10 overs per side, designed for extremely quick matches.<br>
Club and informal cricket: At the amateur level, matches can have a variety of durations and rules. This includes declaration cricket, limited-overs matches, and backyard games. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-test" class="cricket"><strong>Test</strong><br>A Cricket Test match is the oldest and longest format of the sport, considered the most prestigious "test" of a team's skill and endurance. Played by the top national teams, these matches can last up to five days, with each team batting and bowling over two innings. <br>
Match structure:<br>
Duration:<br> A Test match is played over a maximum of five days, with approximately six hours of cricket scheduled each day.<br>
Innings:<br> The match consists of up to four innings in total—two for each team.<br>
Sessions and breaks:<br> Each day is divided into three sessions, separated by a 40-minute lunch break and a 20-minute tea break. The breaks allow players to rest and regroup.<br>
Attire:<br> Players traditionally wear white or off-white clothing.
How to win:<br>
For a team to win a Test match, they must:<br>
Score more runs than the opposition.<br>
Dismiss (bowl out) the opposing team twice. <br>
The match can also end in one of three ways:<br>
Win/Loss:<br> The result if one team successfully dismisses the other twice and has the higher total score.<br>
Draw:<br> A draw is declared if the match concludes after five days and a winner has not been decided.<br>
Tie:<br> A tie is a statistically rare outcome where both teams' total scores are equal and the team batting last has been dismissed. <br>
Key concepts and rules:<br>
Overs:<br> A bowler delivers six balls in a row, which constitutes an "over". A minimum of 90 overs is typically scheduled to be bowled each day.<br>
Declaration: <br>The batting team's captain can "declare" an innings closed at any point to gain a tactical advantage.<br>
Follow-on:<br> If a team bats first and has a substantial lead over the opponent's first innings score (150+ runs in a five-day match), they can enforce a "follow-on," forcing the opponent to bat again immediately. <br>
World Test Championship:<br>
Test cricket's premier international competition is the ICC World Test Championship (WTC), which features a league format and culminates in a final between the top two teams. The first season began in 2019, and points are awarded for wins and draws, with penalties for slow over-rates.<br>
Why is Test cricket unique?:<br>
Test matches are a severe mental and physical examination for players due to the format's long playing time and tactical depth. While shorter formats like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) have grown in popularity, Test cricket remains the game's traditional and highly respected form.<br> <a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-one-day" class="cricket"><strong>ODI</strong><br>An ODI, or One Day International, is a limited-overs cricket match played between two international teams. Each team bats for a single innings, which is currently limited to 50 overs. This format is the basis for the ICC Cricket World Cup, one of the world's most-watched sporting events. <br>
Basic rules and structure:<br>
Two teams:<br> An ODI is contested by two teams of 11 players.<br>
Innings:<br> The match consists of two innings, with one team batting and the other bowling and fielding during each innings.<br>
50 overs:<br> Each team's innings is capped at 50 overs. If the batting team is "all out" (loses 10 of its 11 wickets) before reaching 50 overs, the innings ends.<br>
Winning the match:<br> The team that bats second must score more runs than the team that batted first to win. The team bowling second can win by dismissing the opposition or by preventing them from reaching the target score within their 50 overs.<br>
Timing:<br> ODIs typically last about seven to eight hours, including a break between innings, and are played in a single day.<br>
Equipment:<br> International ODIs are played with a white ball and feature teams wearing colored uniforms, a practice introduced in the late 1970s. <br>
Fielding restrictions:<br>
To promote attacking batting, ODIs include fielding restrictions, commonly known as powerplays, which limit the number of fielders allowed outside a 30-yard circle. <br>
Overs 1 to 10 (Powerplay 1): <br>A maximum of two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle.<br>
Overs 11 to 40 (Powerplay 2): <br>A maximum of four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle.<br>
Overs 41 to 50 (Powerplay 3):<br> A maximum of five fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. <br>
Key competitions:<br>
The ODI format is featured in several major international tournaments:<br>
ICC Cricket World Cup: <br>A men's tournament held every four years.<br>
ICC Women's Cricket World Cup:<br> The women's equivalent, first held in 1973.<br>
ICC Champions Trophy:<br> A biennial tournament contested by the top-ranked ODI teams. <br>
A stepping stone between formats:<br>
The ODI format is a middle ground between the long, five-day Test matches and the fast-paced, 20-over T20 matches. This creates a distinct strategic challenge, as teams must balance an attacking mentality with defensive play over the course of a day. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-t20" class="cricket"><strong>T20</strong><br>Twenty20, or T20, is a fast-paced, shortened format of cricket in which each team bats for a single innings limited to a maximum of 20 overs. A typical T20 match is completed in about three to four hours, far shorter than the multiple days required for Test cricket. This format was created to attract wider audiences by emphasizing aggressive, high-scoring play and delivering quick results. <br>
How a T20 match works:<br>
Teams and innings: <br>A T20 match is played between two teams of 11 players. Each team gets one turn to bat and score runs, while the other team bowls and fields.<br>
Overs:<br> The key distinction of T20 is the 20-over limit for each team's innings. An "over" consists of six legal deliveries from the bowler.<br>
Scoring runs:<br> Batters can score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, or by hitting the ball to or over the boundary.<br>
A ball that hits the ground before crossing the boundary rope is an automatic 4 runs.<br>
A ball hit over the boundary on the field (without bouncing) is an automatic 6 runs.<br>
Dismissing a batter: <br>The fielding team can get a batter "out" in several ways, including knocking over the stumps with the bowled ball (bowled) or catching the ball after it is hit but before it touches the ground (caught). An innings ends when 10 batters are out or when all 20 overs have been bowled.<br>
Winning:<br> The team that scores the most runs wins the match. <br>
Unique rules and elements:<br>
T20 uses many of the traditional Laws of Cricket, but with key variations designed for a quicker game. <br>
Maximum bowling overs:<br> Each individual bowler is limited to a maximum of four overs per match.<br>
Powerplay:<br> A mandatory six-over powerplay at the start of an innings limits the number of fielders allowed outside a 30-yard circle, which encourages batters to hit aggressive shots early on.<br>
Free hit: <br>If a bowler delivers an illegal "no-ball" (e.g., by overstepping the crease), the fielding team is penalized with one or two runs, and the next delivery is a "free hit." On a free hit, a batter cannot be dismissed through a caught, bowled, or LBW (leg before wicket) dismissal.<br>
Super Over: <br>If a match ends in a tie, a "Super Over" is played to determine the winner. Each team bats for a single six-ball over, and the one with the higher score wins. <br>
Major T20 competitions:<br>
T20 is now played at both the international and domestic levels, with several prominent leagues and tournaments around the world. <br>
T20 World Cup: <br>The pinnacle of international T20 cricket, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In 2024, the tournament expanded to include 20 national teams.<br>
Indian Premier League (IPL):<br> Established in 2008, the IPL is one of the richest and most popular T20 leagues in the world. It features a high-stakes franchise model with top-tier players.<br>
Other domestic leagues: <br>Many countries host their own professional T20 leagues that attract players from around the globe, including:<br>
Big Bash League (Australia)<br>
Pakistan Super League (Pakistan)<br>
Caribbean Premier League (West Indies)<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="cricket-field-equipment" class="cricket"><strong>Field/Equipment</strong><br>A cricket field is a large oval or circular grass field, with a central rectangular pitch that is 22 yards long. Specialized equipment is used for batting, bowling, wicket-keeping, and fielding, along with protective gear for player safety.<br>
The cricket field:<br>
The cricket field includes a large playing ground and a centrally located pitch.<br>
Pitch: <br>A rectangular strip in the middle of the ground, measuring 22 yards (20.12 meters) long and 10 feet (3.04 meters) wide.<br>
Creases: <br>Lines marked on the pitch that define a batter's safe ground.<br>
Bowling crease:<br> The line a bowler's back foot must remain behind during delivery.<br>
Popping crease:<br> The line in front of the stumps that a batter must cross to score a run or avoid a run-out.<br>
Return crease: <br>The lines a bowler must stay within during their run-up.<br>
Wickets:<br> A set of three wooden stumps topped with two small wooden bails, placed at each end of the pitch. A wicket is broken when a bail is dislodged from the stumps.<br>

<p id="cricket-field" class="cricket"><strong>Field</strong><br>A cricket field consists of a large, oval-shaped grass field with a rectangular, prepared strip of ground called the pitch at its center. A boundary rope marks the perimeter, and two sets of wooden wickets are placed at opposite ends of the pitch.<br>
Field dimensions and sections:<br>
Overall shape and size:<br> The outer boundary of a cricket field can vary in size and is typically oval or circular. Most professional grounds are between 450 and 500 feet (137 to 152 m) in diameter.<br>
Boundary:<br> A rope or fence marks the outer limit of the playing area. When a batter hits the ball to or over the boundary, runs are scored automatically.<br>
Outfield:<br> The large, grassy area between the pitch and the boundary is known as the outfield.<br>
The Square:<br> An area of specially prepared grass in the center of the field where pitches are prepared for matches.<br>
The pitch:<br>
The pitch is the most crucial part of the field, where most of the action takes place. It is a rectangular strip 22 yards (20.12 m) long and 10 feet (3.05 m) wide.<br>
Wickets:<br>
Stumps: <br>At each end of the pitch, three upright wooden stakes, called stumps, are hammered into the ground.<br>
Bails:<br> Two wooden crosspieces, known as bails, sit atop grooves on the stumps. A wicket is considered broken when a bail is dislodged.<br>
Wicket ends:<br> The pitch has a "batting end" for the batter and a "bowling end" for the bowler.<br>
Pitch markings (Creases):<br>
Four white lines, or creases, are painted at each end of the pitch to help the umpires make decisions.<br>
Bowling crease:<br> A line 8 feet 8 inches long, on which the stumps are placed.<br>
Popping (batting) crease: <br>A line drawn parallel to and 4 feet in front of the bowling crease. Batters must remain within this line to avoid being run out or stumped.<br>
Return creases:<br> Lines drawn at right angles to the popping crease, which help define the bowler's legal delivery area.<br>
Fielding circles (Limited-overs cricket):<br>
In limited-overs formats, like T20s and ODIs, additional markings are used to enforce fielding restrictions.<br>
Inner fielding circle:<br> A circle with a 15-yard (14 m) radius, often marked with dots.<br>
Outer fielding circle: <br>An oval boundary created by two semi-circles with a 30-yard (27 m) radius, connected by parallel lines.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-pitch" class="cricket"><strong>Pitch</strong><br>A cricket pitch is the rectangular central strip of a cricket field where most of the game's action takes place. It is 22 yards (20.12 meters) long and 10 feet (3.05 meters) wide, featuring a wicket at each end. The condition and characteristics of the pitch are crucial, significantly affecting how the game unfolds. <br>
Pitch dimensions and markings:<br>
The field of play is defined by several important lines, or "creases," that guide the players' movements and help umpires make decisions. <br>
Bowling crease:<br> The line on which the stumps are placed at each end of the pitch. It is 8 feet, 8 inches (2.64 meters) long.<br>
Popping crease (batting crease):<br> A line drawn parallel to the bowling crease and 4 feet (1.22 meters) in front of it. A batter must remain behind this line to avoid being stumped or run out. Bowlers must also have part of their front foot behind this line when they bowl.<br>
Return creases: <br>These lines are perpendicular to the popping crease and run alongside the stumps. They define the area within which the bowler must deliver the ball. A bowler's back foot must land within these creases to avoid a no-ball.<br>
Wickets:<br> At each end of the pitch, a wicket consisting of three wooden stumps topped by two bails is set up. <br>
Types of pitches:<br>
Pitches are primarily made of clay-based soil and grass, and their characteristics can vary greatly based on preparation, location, and climate. Different types of pitches affect how the ball behaves after bouncing. <br>
Green pitch ("Green top"): <br>This pitch has a significant covering of grass. The moisture in the grass and the surface makes the ball move unpredictably off the seam, favoring fast and seam bowlers.<br>
Dry pitch:<br> A pitch with little grass and low moisture, which often develops cracks as a multi-day match progresses. Initially, it can be good for batting, but as the cracks and rough areas form, it becomes very difficult for batters and greatly assists spin bowlers.<br>
Dusty pitch ("Dustbowl"):<br> An extremely dry, crumbling surface that produces sharp turn for spin bowlers. These are often seen in the subcontinent and provide a significant advantage to the bowling side.<br>
Flat track ("Batting paradise"):<br> A pitch that has been rolled smooth and hard, offering minimal movement or assistance to bowlers. These are ideal for batters and often lead to high-scoring matches.<br>
Hybrid pitch:<br> A modern innovation that blends natural grass with synthetic fibers. These pitches offer greater durability and more consistent bounce for longer periods. <br>
Pitch condition and maintenance:<br>
The groundskeeper is responsible for preparing and maintaining the pitch, a process that can involve various techniques. <br>
Rolling:<br> A heavy roller is used to compact the soil, making the surface smoother and harder, which increases the pace and bounce of the ball.<br>
Covering:<br> Pitches can be covered with protective sheets to protect them from rain and dew. Keeping a pitch covered or uncovered significantly impacts its moisture level and how the ball behaves.<br>
Protected area ("Danger area"):<br> The central area of the pitch is protected from bowlers' footmarks during their follow-through. This rule prevents unfair damage to the part of the pitch where the ball usually lands, ensuring fair play. <br>
Factors that influence pitch behavior:<br>
Soil and moisture: <br>The type of soil, how well it's compacted, and its moisture content are the primary factors that determine a pitch's hardness, pace, and bounce.<br>
Weather conditions: <br>Rain, humidity, and sun can change the pitch's behavior over the course of a match, especially in longer formats like Test cricket. Dry, sunny weather causes the surface to crack, while dampness can make it "sticky".<br>
Wear and tear: <br>As a match progresses, the constant batting and bowling wear down the surface. This can create rough patches and cracks that spin bowlers can exploit to generate more turn. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="hockeycricketmultipage.html">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-wicket" class="cricket"><strong>Wicket</strong><br>The main pieces of a cricket wicket are the three upright stumps and the two smaller bails that sit across the top. A "wicket" can refer to the whole structure, a single dismissal of a batsman, or the strip of pitch between the two sets of stumps. <br>
Equipment specifications:<br>
According to the Laws of Cricket, the equipment has precise measurements: <br>
Stumps:<br> Three stumps are inserted into the ground. Each must be 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall. They are typically made of wood, often ash.<br>
Bails:<br> Two wooden bails rest in grooves on top of the stumps. Each is 4.31 inches (10.95 cm) long and should not project more than 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) above the stumps.<br>
Wicket width:<br> The total width of the three stumps and two bails is 9 inches (22.86 cm). <br>
Types of wickets:<br>
Beyond the traditional wooden equipment, modern and training variants exist:<br>
Wooden stumps:<br> The classic equipment used in professional matches. They are traditionally made of ash wood.<br>
LED stumps:<br> These are an innovation used in major professional white-ball cricket. They have built-in LEDs that flash when the bails are dislodged, helping umpires with close decisions.<br>
Heavy bails:<br> Heavier wooden bails are sometimes used in windy conditions to prevent them from being blown off the stumps. Umpires may even remove the bails completely if it is too windy.<br>
Freestanding stumps:<br> Equipment made of metal or plastic often comes with a weighted base. They are used for practice on surfaces like concrete, artificial turf, or in a backyard where the stumps cannot be hammered into the ground.<br>
Training stumps:<br> For practice purposes, some brands produce single target stumps, spring-back stumps, or multi-stumps. <br>
Rules for a "broken" wicket:<br>
A batsman is out in several situations when the wicket is broken (or "put down"). This occurs when: <br>
One or both bails are removed from the stumps.<br>
A stump is struck out of the ground. <br>
The wicket can be broken by:<br>
The ball.<br>
A fielder's hand or arm holding the ball.<br>
The batsman's bat or any part of their body or clothing. <br>
Setting up a wicket:<br>
Mark the popping crease on the pitch. In a full-size match, there are two wickets, 22 yards apart.<br>
Use a mallet to drive the stumps into the ground with their tapered end. <br>Start with the middle stump in the center of the crease.<br>
Position the off and leg stumps so they are 9 inches apart and parallel to each other.<br>
Place the two bails in the grooves on top of the stumps. <br>

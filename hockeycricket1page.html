<p id="hockey-paragraph" class="hockey"><strong>Ice hockey</strong> is a fast-paced team sport where two teams of six players on ice skates use sticks to move a puck into the opposing team's net, aiming to score goals. Played on a rectangular ice rink, a match consists of three 20-minute periods, with the team scoring the most goals declared the winner. The sport is known for its physical contact and includes key roles like a goalie, skaters, and specific zones on the ice, with rules designed to manage offsides and the use of the puck.<br><br>

<p id="hockey-obj" class="hockey"><strong>Objective</strong><br>The primary objective in ice hockey is for one team to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting the puck into the opponent's net.<br> Players use a hockey stick to control and pass the puck on the ice, with the goal of getting it completely across the opponent's goal line and into the net, which is defended by a goaltender.<br> The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. <br>
Here are the key elements of the objective:<br>
Scoring a Goal:<br>
A goal is scored when the puck completely crosses the goal line into the net. <br>
Using a Stick:<br>
Players use a hockey stick to propel the puck.<br> 
Preventing Opponent's Goals<br>
While trying to score, each team also defends its own net to prevent the other team from scoring. <br>
Winning the Game:<br>
The team that scores the most goals by the end of the allotted time wins the game.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-equipment" class="hockey"><strong>Equipment</strong><br>Whether you are a player or a goalie, you will need a full set of protective gear, a stick, and skates to play ice hockey safely.<br> When purchasing new equipment, it is important to choose gear that fits correctly and is appropriate for your age and skill level.<br>
For all skaters (non-goalies)
Helmet and face mask:<br> A helmet must be properly fitted and have a Hockey Equipment Certification Council (HECC) approved facemask or cage. <br>Adult players have the option of wearing a visor instead of a full face mask.<br>
Neck guard:<br> Worn to protect the exposed area between your chest protector and helmet from skate blades or sticks.<br>
Shoulder pads:<br> These pads provide protection to the shoulders, chest, and back from pucks and collisions.<br>
Elbow pads:<br> Protect your elbow joints and forearms from impacts with the ice, pucks, and other players.<br>
Gloves:<br> Hockey gloves are heavily padded on the outside for protection but have a thin palm to allow for a good feel on the stick.<br>
Jockstrap (men) or pelvic protector (women):<br> Protects the groin area from impact.<br>
Hockey pants:<br> Padded shorts that protect the thighs, hips, and tailbone.<br>
Shin guards:<br> These guards feature a hard plastic shell to protect the shins and knees from pucks and sticks.<br>
Ice skates:<br> Player skates feature a shorter, curved blade for maneuverability and speed. The skates should fit snugly to provide stability and support.<br>
Hockey stick:<br> A player stick has a thin blade and is available in different materials (wood, composite) and flex ratings.<br>
Goalie-specific equipment:<br>
Goalie mask:<br> Goalie masks are custom-fitted and designed to protect against direct, high-speed impacts from pucks.<br>
Chest and arm protector:<br> Much bulkier and more padded than a player's shoulder pads, protecting the chest, arms, and elbows.<br>
Goalie catch glove ("trapper"):<br> Worn on the non-stick hand to catch and control the puck.<br>
Goalie blocker:<br> Worn on the stick hand, it is a padded glove used to deflect shots.<br>
Goalie pants:<br> Thicker and more heavily padded than player pants.<br>
Goalie leg pads:<br> Thick, flat pads that protect the legs and knees.<br>
Goalie skates:<br> Feature a thicker, flatter blade and more protection around the boot than player skates.<br>
Goalie stick:<br> A goalie stick has a wider, flatter shaft and a larger blade.<br>
Apparel and accessories:<br>
Jersey and socks:<br> Your team jersey is worn over the pads, and hockey socks cover the shin guards.<br>
Undergarments:<br> A base layer is recommended to wick away sweat and keep you dry.<br>
Tape:<br> Tape is used for both the stick blade for grip and the shins to secure socks.<br>
Skate guards:<br> Protect your skate blades from damage when you are not on the ice.<br>
Hockey bag:<br> A large bag is necessary to carry all of your equipment to and from the rink.<br>
How to choose equipment:<br>
When selecting ice hockey equipment, your playing style, position, and budget are all important considerations. Many brands offer different lines of equipment designed for different types of players.
Forwards:<br> Typically prefer lighter-weight gear and a lower kick point on their stick for quick wrist shots and agility.<br>
Defensemen:<br> Often opt for heavier, more protective gear and a higher kick point on their stick for powerful slap shots.<br>
Beginners:<br> Can start with more budget-friendly, entry-level equipment that still meets all necessary safety requirements.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="hockey-rink" class="hockey"><strong>Rink</strong><br>An ice hockey rink has different dimensions depending on the league. A rink is divided into three zones by a center red line and two blue lines, and it has specialized markings for faceoffs, goals, and goaltender areas. 
Rink dimensions:<br>
There are two primary sizes for hockey rinks, which influence the style of play. 
Feature NHL (North American) IIHF (International/Olympic)
Length	200 feet (61 meters) 200 feet (61 meters)
Width	85 feet (26 meters)	 98.4 feet (30 meters)
Play style	More compact and physical due to less space.Faster, with more open ice and creative plays.
Rink zones:<br>
Defensive zone:<br> The area where a team defends its goal, located from the end boards to the first blue line.<br>
Neutral zone:<br> The center of the rink, between the two blue lines, where teams battle for possession.<br>
Offensive zone:<br> The zone where a team attempts to score, extending from the opponent's blue line to the end boards.<br> 
Key markings:<br>
Goal line:<br> A thin red line that runs across the width of the rink, 11 feet from the end boards. A goal is scored when the puck completely crosses this line.<br>
Center line:<br> A red line that divides the rink in half and is used for icing calls.<br>
Blue lines:<br> Two thick blue lines that divide the rink into the three zones and are used to determine offside violations.<br>
Faceoff circles and dots:<br> A set of nine faceoff spots on the ice used to start or restart play.<br>
Goal crease: <br>The semi-circular area in front of each goal where the goaltender receives additional protection from interference.<br>
Goaltender trapezoid:<br> The area behind the goal line, extending to the end boards, where the goaltender is permitted to play the puck.<br> 
Other components:<br>
Boards:<br> The walls surrounding the rink, topped with plexiglass to protect spectators.<br>
Benches:<br> Each team's bench is where players sit when not on the ice. The penalty boxes are located on the opposite side of the rink.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="hockey-teams" class="hockey"><strong>Teams</strong><br>In standard ice hockey rules, each team has six players on the ice at one time during normal play. This includes one goalie and five "skaters". 
The five skaters typically consist of:<br>
Three forwards:<br> A center and two wingers (left and right).<br>
Two defensemen.<br> 
Other variations:<br>
Penalties:<br> If a team takes a penalty, they will play with fewer skaters on the ice for a set period of time, giving the opposing team a power play.<br>
Extra attacker:<br> A team losing late in a game may "pull" their goalie and replace them with an extra skater to increase their offensive chances.<br>
Rosters:<br> The total number of players on a team's full roster is much larger than the six on the ice. In the NHL, for example, a team can have an active roster of up to 23 players. For each game, 20 of those players (18 skaters and two goalies) will be dressed and ready to play.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-structure" class="hockey"><strong>Structure</strong><br>In professional ice hockey leagues like the NHL, a standard game is structured into three periods. 

Periods:<br>	Three periods, each lasting 20 minutes of stop-time play, according to XbotGo. The clock stops for events like goals, penalties, and official reviews.<br>
Intermissions:<br>	There are two intermissions between periods, typically lasting 15 to 18 minutes. These breaks allow for ice resurfacing and player rest and strategy discussions.<br>
Overtime:<br> (Regular Season)	If the game is tied after the three periods, a 5-minute sudden-death overtime period is played. The first team to score wins. This overtime is played in a 3-on-3 format (excluding goaltenders).<br>
Shootout:<br> (Regular Season)	If no team scores during the overtime period, the game proceeds to a shootout. Each team selects three players to take alternating penalty shots against the opposing goalie. The team with the most goals after three rounds wins. If still tied, the shootout continues in sudden-death rounds.<br>
Overtime:<br> (Playoffs)	In playoff games, if a game is tied after the three periods, teams continue to play full 20-minute periods of 5-on-5 sudden-death hockey until a goal is scored. There is no shootout in playoff overtime.<br>
Game Duration:<br>	Including stoppages, intermissions, and potential overtime or shootouts, a typical hockey game can last between 2.5 to 3 hours.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="hockey-control" class="hockey"><strong>Control</strong><br>In ice hockey, puck control refers to a player or team's ability to maintain possession of the puck, which is critical for generating scoring chances and controlling the flow of the game.However, there are several rules and concepts that govern how players can legally control the puck.<br> 
Key concepts of puck control:<br>
Puck possession and control:<br> The official USA Hockey rulebook distinguishes between having "possession" and having "control" of the puck.<br>
Possession:<br> A player has possession when they are the last to touch the puck, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are directing it. A player with only possession is not eligible to be body-checked.<br>
Control:<br> A player has control when they have possession and are guiding the puck in a desired direction, either by using their stick, skates, or hands. A player with control is eligible to be legally body-checked.<br>
Body positioning:<br> A player who is in control of the puck can use their body to shield it from an opponent. They are legally entitled to the ice they occupy and can use a free hand to maintain their body position, as long as they don't grab an opponent.<br>
Team puck support:<br> Effective puck control is a team effort. Players without the puck must constantly move to create passing lanes and support the puck carrier. Coaches often teach players to "re-group" or cycle the puck in the offensive zone to maintain possession when faced with defensive pressure.<br> 
Rules related to puck control:<br>
Stickhandling:<br> While stickhandling is the primary way to control the puck, there are restrictions on how players can use their sticks to gain possession. A player may lift an opponent's stick to gain the puck, but they cannot use their stick to hook, hold, or trip an opponent.<br>
Handling the puck with hands:<br>
An exception is that a player in their defensive zone can bat the puck with an open hand to a teammate, as long as the pass is not directed forward.<br>
If a player (other than the goalie) closes their hand on the puck, play is stopped.<br>
A minor penalty is called if a player picks up the puck with their hand or deliberately falls on it to gain an advantage.
In the offensive or neutral zone, a player cannot direct the puck to a teammate with their hand. This results in a face-off.<br>
High-sticking the puck:<br> Players cannot intentionally contact the puck with their stick above shoulder height. If a player high-sticks the puck and their team gains control, play is stopped. If the opposing team gains control, play continues.<br>
Body checking:<br> A player can only be body-checked if they are in control of the puck. A body check to a player who is no longer in control of the puck is a penalty for a "late hit" and is considered dangerous.<br> 
Why these rules matter:<br>
These rules ensure that the game is a contest of stick skills, skating, and strategy, rather than a physical brawl for a loose puck. By regulating how players can handle and control the puck, the rules promote a fair and safe environment for competition at all levels.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-physical" class="hockey"><strong>Physicality</strong><br>Ice hockey is an intensely physical and high-contact sport where players use their bodies and sticks to compete for the puck and gain a competitive advantage. While often associated with fighting and body checking, modern physicality in hockey is more nuanced and strictly regulated.<br> 
Types of physical contact:<br>
Body checking:<br> A defensive technique used to separate an opponent from the puck. In leagues that permit it, checks are delivered with the shoulder, upper arm, hip, and torso to knock an opponent off balance or into the boards.<br>
Legal checks must be delivered to an opponent with possession of the puck, from the front or side, and with the primary purpose of gaining possession.<br>
Illegal checks are subject to penalties, and include checking from behind, targeting the head, or hitting an opponent without possession of the puck.<br>
Stick checking:<br> Non-penalized defensive moves that involve using the stick to dislodge the puck from an opponent.<br> These include:<br>
Poke checking:<br> Jabbing the stick at the puck.<br>
Sweep checking:<br> Using a sweeping motion to knock the puck away.<br>
Lift checking:<br> Lifting an opponent's stick to foil their move.<br>
Roughing: <br>Unnecessary or aggressive contact, such as pushing and shoving, that happens outside of legal body checking. This can also be called for late hits after an opponent has released the puck or after the whistle.<br>
Battling for positioning:<br> Players frequently engage in competitive contact to maintain their position, such as when jockeying for space in front of the net or along the boards. This is considered a strategic and legal use of physicality.<br> 
Physicality and the rules of play:<br>
While physicality is part of the game, it is strictly governed by penalties to ensure player safety and maintain order.<br> 
Minor penalty:<br> A two-minute penalty, such as for tripping, hooking, or roughing.<br>
Major penalty:<br> A five-minute penalty, most commonly for fighting. A major penalty is also assessed for minor penalties committed with an intent to injure.<br>
Match penalty:<br> Results in the player's ejection for actions that recklessly endanger an opponent.<br>
Game misconduct:<br> A 10-minute penalty that removes a player from the game. Unlike other penalties, the team is allowed to replace the penalized player.<br> 
The controversial role of fighting:<br>
Fighting is a highly visible form of physicality in ice hockey and its role continues to be debated.<br> 
Legality:<br> Fighting is technically a violation of the rules, though in some professional leagues like the NHL, players are only assessed a five-minute major penalty for participating. In college, European, and Olympic hockey, players can be ejected.<br>
Entertainment and tradition:<br> Fighting is deeply ingrained in the sport's history, and many fans consider it an exciting part of the game.<br>
Accountability:<br> Historically, fighting has been seen by many players as a way to "police" the game and deter opponents from taking cheap shots or dangerous hits. This practice has declined in recent years, with teams opting for more "smart" physicality rather than relying on designated fighters.<br> 
A changing game:<br>
Physicality in hockey has evolved over time, with a greater emphasis on player safety.<br>
Rule enforcement:<br> The NHL has implemented stricter rule enforcement to reduce dangerous hits, particularly those involving the head, in response to growing concern over concussions.<br>
Age-based rules:<br> In youth hockey, organizations like USA Hockey have raised the age at which body checking is introduced to prevent injuries and promote skill development.<br>
Evolution of strategy:<br> Modern professional hockey increasingly favors speed, skill, and strategic positioning over brute force. While still physical, the game prioritizes using the body to win puck battles without taking unnecessary risks.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-zones" class="hockey"><strong>Zones</strong><br>In ice hockey, the rink is divided into three zones by two blue lines: the defensive zone, the neutral zone, and the offensive or attacking zone. The location of these zones changes depending on which team has the puck. 
The three zones:<br>
Defensive zone:<br> This is the area of the ice from your team's own goal line to your team's blue line. As the name implies, it's the area your team defends to prevent the opponent from scoring.<br>
Neutral zone:<br> The neutral zone is the 50-foot area between the two blue lines, also known as center ice.<br>
Offensive or attacking zone:<br> This is the area between the opponent's blue line and their goal line. It is the space from which your team will most typically score.<br> 
Key zone-related rules:<br>
Offside:<br>
The offside rule governs when a player can enter the offensive zone. <br>
How it works: <br>An attacking player cannot cross the opponent's blue line before the puck does.<br>
Position matters:<br> A player is considered offside if both of their skates are completely over the blue line before the puck fully crosses it. The position of a player's stick does not affect the offside call.<br>
Delayed offside:<br> In professional leagues like the NHL, a "delayed offside" is called if an attacking player enters the zone before the puck. The play continues as long as the offside players do not touch the puck. To end the delayed offside, all attacking players must "tag up" by exiting the offensive zone and touching the blue line.<br> 
Icing:<br>
Icing is a rule designed to prevent a defending team from indiscriminately clearing the puck down the length of the ice to relieve pressure. <br>
How it works:<br> A team commits an icing infraction if a player shoots the puck from their own side of the center red line, and the puck crosses the opponent's goal line without being touched by a player.<br>
Outcome:<br> The result is a stoppage of play and a face-off in the offending team's defensive zone.<br> 
The blue line:<br>
The blue line's classification can change depending on the puck's position.<br> 
When the puck is in the neutral zone, the blue line is part of the neutral zone.<br>
Once the puck has completely crossed the blue line into an end zone, the blue line becomes part of that end zone.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-penalties" class="hockey"><strong>Penalties</strong><br>In ice hockey, penalties are infractions that result in time in the penalty box for the offending player and a power play for the opposing team. Penalties are categorized by their severity and can range from minor infractions to intentional, dangerous actions. Other stoppages of play, like icing and offsides, are not penalties but do result in a face-off.<br> 
Common penalties:<br>
Minor penalties:<br>
These are the most common infractions and result in a player being sent to the penalty box for two minutes. The opposing team receives a "power play," and if they score, the penalty ends early. A double-minor (four-minute penalty) is often assessed if the infraction draws blood. Common minor penalties include:<br> 
Tripping:<br> Causing an opponent to fall with a stick or body.<br>
Hooking:<br> Using the stick to impede an opponent's progress.<br>
High-sticking: <br>Hitting an opponent with a stick held above shoulder level.<br>
Holding:<br> Grabbing an opponent's body or equipment.<br>
Interference:<br> Impeding an opponent who does not have the puck.<br>
Roughing: <br>Pushing or shoving an opponent. Sometimes called for fights not deemed serious enough for a major penalty.<br>
Delay of game:<br> Stalling the game, such as by shooting the puck out of play. <br>
Major penalties:<br>
A more severe infraction that results in a five-minute penalty. Unlike a minor penalty, a major is served in its entirety, even if the opposing team scores. Major penalties are often assessed for more violent acts and can sometimes include an automatic game misconduct.<br> 
Fighting:<br> A physical altercation involving punches.<br>
Boarding:<br> Violently pushing an opponent into the boards.<br>
Spearing:<br> Stabbing an opponent with the blade of the stick.<br>
Cross-checking:<br> Hitting an opponent with the shaft of the stick held with both hands.<br>
Checking from behind:<br> Hitting an opponent from their blindside. <br>
Misconduct and match penalties:<br>
Misconduct penalty:<br> A 10-minute penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct or repeated rule violations. The penalized player sits in the penalty box, but a substitute can enter the game, so the team does not play short-handed.<br>
Game misconduct penalty:<br> The player is ejected from the game and sent to the dressing room. If assessed with a major penalty, a teammate serves the five-minute short-handed time.<br>
Match penalty:<br> Assessed for a deliberate attempt to injure an opponent. It results in ejection and a five-minute penalty served by a teammate. <br>
Penalty shot:<br>
A penalty shot is a one-on-one attempt by a player to score on the opposing goaltender, with no other players on the ice. It is awarded when a player on a breakaway is fouled from behind and is denied a clear scoring opportunity. The penalty shot is also used in a shootout to determine a winner in a tied game. <br>
Non-penalty infractions:<br>
Icing:<br>
Icing occurs when a player shoots the puck from their own side of the center red line all the way down the ice, and it crosses the opponent's goal line without being touched by any player. The result is a stoppage in play and a face-off in the offending team's defensive zone. Icing is not called if the team is playing short-handed.<br> 
Offside:<br>
Offside occurs when any attacking player enters the offensive zone before the puck does. This results in a face-off in the neutral zone.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-ties-overtime" class="hockey"><strong>Ties/Overtime</strong><br>Most hockey leagues no longer allow games to end in a tie, instead using overtime and/or a shootout to determine a winner. While the exact format depends on the league and whether the game is a regular-season or playoff match, all overtime periods are sudden-death, meaning the first team to score wins.<br> 
NHL overtime and ties:<br>
In the National Hockey League (NHL), the rules for regular-season games are different from the postseason. <br>
Regular season:<br>
If a game is tied after 60 minutes of regulation, the following occurs:<br>
5-minute overtime period:<br> A single five-minute, sudden-death overtime period is played with three skaters per side, plus a goalie.<br>
Shootout:<br> If no goal is scored during overtime, the game proceeds to a shootout.<br>
Each team selects three players to take alternating shots on the opposing goalie.<br>
The team with the most goals after three rounds wins.<br>
If the score is still tied after three rounds, the shootout continues in a sudden-death format, where each team gets one more shot until a winner is determined.<br>
Standings points:<br>
Winner:<br> Gets two points.<br>
Overtime/Shootout loser:<br> Gets one point.<br>
Regulation loser:<br> Gets zero points. <br>
Stanley Cup playoffs:<br>
During the Stanley Cup playoffs, there are no shootouts.<br> 
Continuous 20-minute periods:<br> The teams continue to play 20-minute sudden-death periods at full 5-on-5 strength until a goal is scored.<br>
Intermissions:<br> The ice is resurfaced between overtime periods.<br> 
International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and Olympics:<br>
Overtime rules vary for IIHF tournaments, including the Olympics, depending on the stage of the competition.<br> 
Preliminary and round-robin games:<br>
5-minute overtime:<br> Games tied after regulation are decided by a five-minute, 3-on-3 sudden-death overtime.<br>
Shootout: <br>If no team scores in overtime, the game goes to a three-round shootout. It will proceed to a sudden-death shootout if the tie persists.<br> 
Playoff and bronze medal games:<br>
10-minute overtime:<br> After a three-minute intermission, a 10-minute, 3-on-3 sudden-death overtime is played.<br>
Shootout:<br> If still tied, a five-round shootout is conducted. The shootout proceeds to sudden death if necessary.<br> 
Gold medal game:<br>
Continuous 20-minute periods:<br> Overtime consists of 20-minute sudden-death periods of 3-on-3 hockey. There is a 15-minute intermission to resurface the ice between periods.<br>
No shootout:<br> The game continues until a winning goal is scored.<br> 
NCAA:<br>
NCAA hockey rules can vary based on conference for regular-season games, but postseason tournaments have a consistent format.<br> 
Regular season:<br>
5-minute overtime:<br> A five-minute, 3-on-3 sudden-death overtime is played.<br>
Ties or shootouts:<br> After overtime, some conferences allow games to end in a tie, while others use a shootout to determine a winner for conference standings. For official NCAA record-keeping, a game that goes to a shootout is still recorded as a tie. <br>
National tournament:<br>
Continuous 20-minute periods:<br> Games tied after regulation continue with 20-minute, 5-on-5 sudden-death overtime periods until a goal is scored.<br>
No shootouts:<br> There are no shootouts in the NCAA national tournament.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-origin" class="hockey"><strong>Origins</strong><br>Ice hockey evolved from a variety of stick-and-ball games played on ice and grass in the 18th and 19th centuries, but its modern form was developed and popularized in Canada. Considered Canada's national winter sport, ice hockey has grown from its Canadian roots to become a global game with massive popularity in North America and Europe.<br> 
Origins in Canada and Europe;<br>
The origins of ice hockey are complex, influenced by several games played by European immigrants and Indigenous peoples in Canada.<br> 
European Stick-and-Ball Games:<br> Versions of sports like bandy from England, hurling from Ireland, and shinty from Scotland were played on ice in the 19th century. Early Canadian settlers, including British soldiers and immigrants, adapted these games for play on frozen rivers and lakes.<br>
Indigenous Influences:<br> The Mi'kmaq Indigenous people of Nova Scotia played a stick-and-ball game on ice. The Mi'kmaq also made and sold the early hockey sticks used by Europeans.<br>
The First Indoor Game:<br> On March 3, 1875, the first organized indoor ice hockey game was played in Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink. Organized by McGill University student James Creighton, this game introduced several key innovations still in use today, including the use of a flat wooden puck and defined rules. <br>
Key innovations and growth:<br>
Rules and puck:<br> The shift from an unorganized outdoor pastime to a formal indoor sport with rules and a puck helped standardize the game. A flat wooden puck replaced the ball to prevent injuries to spectators and keep the action on the ice surface.<br>
Organized Leagues: <br>The Amateur Hockey Association of Canada was formed in 1886, establishing the first organized league.<br>
The Stanley Cup:<br> In 1892, Canada's Governor General, Lord Stanley of Preston, donated a trophy for the top amateur hockey club in the country. This trophy, the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, later became the professional Stanley Cup. <br>
Rise in popularity:<br>
Early 20th Century Expansion: <br>Early professional leagues, like the International Professional Hockey League (1904) in the U.S. and the National Hockey Association (1910) in Canada, helped boost hockey's popularity. The NHA ultimately led to the formation of the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917.<br>
The NHL:<br> The NHL became the dominant professional league in North America, absorbing teams from other leagues and expanding into the United States in 1924 with the addition of the Boston Bruins.<br>
Global Spread: <br>Ice hockey was introduced as an Olympic sport in 1920, first at the Summer Games and then as a permanent fixture of the Winter Olympics starting in 1924. The establishment of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) helped standardize rules and promote the sport globally.<br>
Women's Hockey: <br>Although women played in the game's early years, women's ice hockey gained significant popularity starting in the mid-1980s. The IIHF Women's World Championship began in 1990, and women's hockey debuted at the Olympics in 1998.<br> <a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="hockey-olympics" class="hockey"><strong>Olympics</strong><br>Ice hockey is a popular Olympic sport played by both men's and women's teams.<br> 
Here's a breakdown of its history and competition details at the Olympics:<br>
History:<br>
Men's ice hockey first appeared at the 1920 Antwerp Summer Games with a seven-a-side format.<br>
It became a permanent fixture at the Winter Olympics in Chamonix in 1924, where the modern six-a-side format was introduced.<br>
Women's ice hockey was added to the program later, making its debut at the 1998 Nagano Winter Games. <br>
Competition:<br>
Games consist of three 20-minute periods.<br>
In Olympic play, games cannot end in a tie, according to the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum.<br>
Overtime periods are played to break ties, followed by a shootout if necessary.<br>
In the gold medal game, ties after regulation are resolved with sudden-death overtime periods of 20 minutes each, with the ice resurfaced between periods, until a goal is scored. <br>
Teams and Players:<br>
Men's teams have a maximum of 25 players (22 skaters and 3 goaltenders).
Women's teams consist of 23 players (20 skaters and 3 goaltenders).
A maximum of six players (five skaters and a goaltender) are on the ice at any given time.<br>
NHL players will be eligible to participate in the upcoming 2026 and 2030 Winter Olympics. <br>
Notable facts:<br>
Canada is the most successful country in Olympic ice hockey, winning 14 gold medals across both men's and women's tournaments.<br>
The "Miracle on Ice," where the U.S. men's team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Union in the 1980 Lake Placid Games, is considered one of the greatest moments in sports history.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="hockey-culture" class="hockey"><strong>Culture</strong><br>Ice hockey holds deep cultural significance as a unifying force, a symbol of national identity, and a beloved tradition in countries like Canada and regions across North America and Europe. Its cultural impact extends far beyond the rink, influencing everything from national folklore to pop culture.<br>
Canada's national identity:<br>
As the birthplace of the modern sport, Canada's national identity is inextricably linked to ice hockey. <br>
National winter sport: <br>Since 1994, ice hockey has been officially designated as Canada's national winter sport.<br>
A cultural cornerstone:<br> For many Canadians, the game is more than a pastime—it is part of the national cultural fabric. Rinks serve as community hubs, and playing or following the sport is often considered a rite of passage.<br>
Symbolic narratives:<br> Hockey reinforces Canadian social values such as teamwork, resilience, and fair play, and its mythos is invoked to unite people across cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic lines.<br>
Hockey Night in Canada:<br> The television broadcast of this show has been an iconic part of Canadian culture since 1952, bringing the nation together to celebrate the sport. <br>
Expressions of national rivalry:<br>
Ice hockey has also been a powerful emblem of national pride and strength during global competitions. <br>
Cold War rivalry:<br> During the Cold War, ice hockey matches between the Soviet Union and North America were symbols of international political and social tension. Russia's emphasis on technical excellence and national strength continues to be expressed through the sport.<br>
International dominance:<br> International tournaments, including the Olympic Games and the IIHF World Championships, serve as a battle of national identities and playing styles. The victories of Canadian teams on the international stage have instilled a powerful sense of national pride.<br> 
Influence on popular culture:<br>
The fast-paced, physical, and emotional nature of hockey has inspired countless works in popular culture.<br> 
Film and television:<br> The sport is featured prominently in films like The Mighty Ducks, Slap Shot, and Goon, as well as television shows like How I Met Your Mother and the Canadian series Letterkenny.<br>
Literature:<br> The classic children's book The Hockey Sweater by Roch Carrier, later adapted into an animated short, is a cultural touchstone in Canada, centering on the Canadiens-Maple Leafs rivalry.<br>
Music: <br>Popular music contains numerous hockey references. The song "The Hockey Theme," the long-time theme music for Hockey Night in Canada, has been dubbed "Canada's second national anthem." Other examples include Stompin' Tom Connors' "The Hockey Song" and Warren Zevon's "Hit Somebody!".<br>
Fashion:<br> Hockey jerseys have moved beyond the rink to become iconic streetwear. Fans wear team colors as a fashion statement, and designers have incorporated hockey-inspired elements like laces and logos into high-end collections. <br>
Community and inclusivity:<br>
On a local level, hockey is a vehicle for building and connecting communities. <br>
Grassroots development:<br> From youth leagues to local pond hockey, the sport fosters a sense of camaraderie and belonging.<br>
Evolution toward inclusivity: <br>As the sport has evolved, efforts have been made to increase its accessibility and inclusivity, with programs that support diverse communities and lower-income families. This helps adapt the sport to reflect the multicultural societies where it is played.<br>
Cultural heritage landscapes:<br> In Canada, the network of indoor and outdoor rinks forms a cultural heritage landscape deeply embedded in the social fabric. While this landscape faces modern threats like climate change and rising costs, community responses show the dedication to preserving this heritage.<br> <a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="hockey-stick" class="hockey"><strong>Stick</strong><br>Hockey sticks come in different materials, constructions, sizes, flex ratings, and blade patterns to suit various players and play styles. Today, composite sticks are most popular, but wooden sticks are also an option, particularly for recreational or outdoor play.<br>
How to choose a stick:<br>
To select the right stick, you need to determine your size and handedness, then decide on the level of performance you need. <br>
Handedness:<br> Your shooting hand is the one holding the stick's butt end. For example, if your right hand is on top, you shoot left. You should use the hand that feels most natural.<br>
Size: <br>A stick is properly sized if, while you are wearing skates, it reaches somewhere between your chin and nose. Most sticks are sold by size categories: youth, junior, intermediate, and senior.<br>
Flex: <br>The flex rating measures how stiff a stick is. A general rule of thumb is to choose a flex that is about half your body weight in pounds. Stronger players may prefer a stiffer flex for more powerful slap shots, while forwards may opt for a more flexible stick for quicker wrist shots.<br>
Kick point:<br> The kick point is where the shaft is designed to bend the most. It is chosen based on your shooting style.<br>
Low-kick:<br> Flexes in the lower part of the stick, designed for a quicker shot release.<br>
Mid-kick:<br> Flexes in the middle of the shaft, providing a balance of power and a quick release.<br>
High-kick:<br> Flexes at the top of the shaft, ideal for powerful slap shots.<br>
Blade curve:<br> The blade's curve affects your ability to shoot, pass, and stickhandle. <br>There are three main types:<br>
Toe curve:<br> Curved mostly at the end of the blade, preferred by forwards for quick lift and toe drags.<br>
Mid curve:<br> Curved in the middle of the blade, offering an all-around balance for stickhandling, passing, and shots.<br>
Heel curve: <br>Curved at the base of the blade, favored by defensemen for powerful slap shots.<br>
Blade face angle: <br>An "open" face helps lift the puck more easily, while a "closed" face is better for puck control and passes.<br>
Stick lie:<br> The lie is the angle between the blade and the shaft. A higher lie is for players who skate more upright, while a lower lie is for those who skate with the puck farther out in front. <br>
Popular hockey stick products:<br>
Bauer Vapor FLYPRO Grip Stick:<br> This high-end composite stick features a low kick point and a carbon fiber shaft and blade for quick release and lightweight performance.<br>
Alpha LX2 Comp Pro Team 65 Flex Stick:<br> A composite stick available with various flex options. The specific "Pro Team" model offers customization.<br>
CCM Jetspeed FT7 Pro:<br> A top-ranked stick known for its performance.<br>

<p id="hockey-skates" class="hockey"><strong>Skates</strong><br>The most important factors for selecting hockey skates are your foot shape, skating style, and ability level. The major brands, Bauer and CCM, offer different skate families to accommodate varying foot profiles, from tapered to wide. For new skates, a professional fitting is highly recommended to ensure the most accurate sizing and best performance.<br>
Foot shape and fit:<br>
The foot has three main attributes that determine skate fit: heel width, instep depth, and forefoot width. The most common fits offered by skate manufacturers are:<br>
Tapered/narrow:<br> For skaters with a standard forefoot and a narrow heel, like those in the Bauer Vapor or CCM JetSpeed lines.<br>
Contoured/anatomical:<br> A medium-width skate that is snug in the heel and forefoot, such as the Bauer Supreme or CCM Tacks lines.<br>
Classic/wide:<br> For skaters with a wider forefoot, often found in Bauer Nexus (now integrated into Supreme) or CCM's wide-fit skates.<br>
Skates by ability level:<br>
Skate performance varies depending on the player's skill level. As a boot increases in stiffness and quality, so does its price.<br>
Recreational (for beginners):<br>
These skates are designed for players new to the game or those skating occasionally.<br>
Build: The boots are softer, more flexible, and prioritize comfort over stiffness and performance.<br>
Products:<br>
Bauer X-LS:<br> An entry-level skate with comfortable construction.
CCM Tacks A27: A beginner-friendly option.<br>
CCM Jetspeed XTRA:<br> These skates offer a comfortable and supportive fit for recreational players, with a flexible boot and memory foam ankle pads.<br>
Performance (intermediate):<br>
This category is for intermediate players on the ice one to two times per week who are confident in their stride.<br>
Build:<br> Performance skates feature a stiffer quarter package for better power and agility and are often heat-moldable for a customized fit.<br>
Products:<br>
Bauer Vapor X4:<br> A performance-level skate for intermediate players<br>
CCM Jetspeed FT670:<br> An intermediate skate with solid performance.<br>
Bauer Supreme M40:<br> A quality intermediate-level skate.<br>
Elite (for advanced players):<br>
Elite skates are built for players on the ice three or more times a week who need maximum performance, protection, and durability.<br>
Build:<br> These are the stiffest, most responsive, and most expensive skates on the market, often featuring one-piece composite boots and advanced technology.<br>
Products:<br>
Bauer Vapor FLYPRO:<br> An elite skate with lightweight, flexible, and reactive materials designed for agility.<br>
CCM Tacks XF Pro: <br>An elite skate offering top-tier performance.
True Catalyst 9X4: A high-end, responsive skate.<br>
How to size skates:<br>
Getting the proper size is the most crucial step in buying skates. A poorly fitting skate can cause blisters, ankle instability, and hinder your performance.<br>
Start by sizing down:<br> Most hockey skate manufacturers suggest purchasing skates that are 1 to 1.5 sizes smaller than your regular shoe size.<br>
Test the fit: <br>With the laces untied and your foot pushed forward, you should have no more than 1/4 inch of space in the heel. Your toes should just barely brush the end of the toe cap.<br>
Check for heel lift:<br> After lacing the skate tightly, stand up and check for heel lift. Your heel should be locked firmly in place and should not move.<br>
Try before you buy:<br> If possible, visit a pro shop to get properly fitted by an expert. You may need to try different brands and models to find the right shape for your foot.<br>
Consider heat-molding:<br> Higher-end skates are often heat-moldable. This process, done at a pro shop, warms the boot material so it forms a custom fit around your foot, significantly reducing the break-in time.<br><a href="#hockey-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>

<p id="cricket-paragraph" class="cricket"><strong>Cricket</strong> is a popular bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on an oval or circular field. The objective is for one team, the batting side, to score as many runs as possible while the other team, the fielding side, tries to get the batters out and restrict the score.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-gameplay">Gameplay</a></strong>:<br> Two batsmen from the batting team are on the pitch, one facing the bowler and the other waiting at the non-striker's end. A bowler from the fielding team bowls the ball toward the batsman, who tries to hit it and score runs by running between the two wickets.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-runs">Scoring runs</a></strong>:<br>
If the batsman and their partner switch ends, they score a single run.<br>
Hitting the ball to the boundary results in four runs, while clearing the boundary rope without it touching the ground is worth six runs.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-out">Dismissing a batsman</a></strong>:<br> Common ways a batsman can be out (or "dismissed") include:<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-bowled">Bowled</a></strong>:<br> The bowler knocks over the wicket behind the batsman with the ball.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-caught">Caught</a></strong>:<br> A fielder catches the ball after it has been hit by the bat, but before it touches the ground.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-lbw">Leg Before Wicket (LBW)</a></strong>:<br> The ball hits the batsman's leg in front of the wicket in a way that would have otherwise bowled them.<br><br>

<strong><a href="#cricket-format">Match formats</a></strong>:<br>
There are three main formats for cricket matches, each with a different duration and pace:<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-test">Test Match</a></strong>:<br> This is the longest and most traditional format, lasting up to five days. Each team has two innings (turns at batting).<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-one-day">One-Day International (ODI)</a></strong>:<br> A shorter version of the game where each team gets a single innings with a limit of 50 overs (an over consists of six balls bowled). A match typically lasts seven to eight hours.<br><br>
<strong><a href="#cricket-t20">Twenty20 (T20)</a></strong>:<br> This is the fastest and most modern format, with each team batting for only 20 overs. A match usually lasts around three to four hours.<br><br>

<p id="cricket-gameplay" class="cricket"><strong>Gameplay</strong> <br>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on a field with a central 22-yard pitch. Teams take turns batting and fielding, with the objective for the batting team being to score runs and the fielding team to dismiss the batters. The game is divided into sections called "innings," and the rules vary significantly depending on the match format. <br>
The field and players:<br>
The pitch:<br> A rectangular strip at the center of the field, where the primary action takes place.<br>
The wickets:<br> Composed of three stumps topped with two small wooden bails, one wicket stands at each end of the pitch.<br>
The teams: <br>Each of the two teams has 11 players.<br>
Fielding Team:<br> All 11 players are on the field. This includes a bowler, a wicket-keeper (similar to a catcher in baseball), and nine other fielders.<br>
Batting Team:<br> Only two players, the batsmen, are on the field at any one time, one at each wicket. <br>
Core gameplay sequence:<br>
Coin Toss:<br> The game begins with a coin toss, and the winning captain chooses whether to bat or field first.<br>
Batting and Fielding: <br>The fielding team's bowler delivers the ball toward the opposite wicket. The batsman tries to hit the ball with their bat and score runs.<br>
End of Innings: <br>The first innings concludes when either 10 of the 11 batters have been dismissed, or a predetermined number of overs (sets of six deliveries) have been bowled.<br>
Role Swap: <br>The teams switch roles. The second team to bat then tries to beat the first team's score. The team with the most runs wins.<br> 
How to score runs:<br>
Running:<br> After the striker hits the ball, the two batters can run to opposite ends of the pitch and switch places. Each successful exchange counts as one run.<br>
Boundaries:<br> If the batter hits the ball to the edge of the field (the boundary), they automatically score runs.<br>
Six runs:<br> Awarded if the ball crosses the boundary without bouncing.<br>
Four runs:<br> Awarded if the ball bounces before crossing the boundary.<br>
Extras:<br> The batting team can also receive extra runs due to bowling errors, such as a "wide" (a delivery too far from the batter) or a "no-ball" (an illegal delivery). <br>
How batters get "out" (dismissed):<br>
The fielding team can get a batter out in several ways, including: <br>
Bowled:<br> The bowler hits the wicket with the ball, dislodging the bails.<br>
Caught:<br> The batter hits the ball into the air, and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground.<br>
Leg Before Wicket (LBW):<br> The ball strikes the batter's leg when it would have otherwise hit the wicket.<br>
Run Out:<br> A fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the batter is attempting to run and is still out of their safe zone (the crease).<br>
Stumped: <br>The wicket-keeper breaks the wicket with the ball while the batter is out of their crease and not attempting a run. <br>
Main formats of play:<br>
The rules can change depending on the match format, which affects the pace and duration of the game. <br>
Test Cricket:<br> The traditional, longest format, played over five days with up to four innings (two per team) and no limit on overs.<br>
One-Day International (ODI):<br> A faster version where each team has a single innings with a maximum of 50 overs.<br>
Twenty20 (T20):<br> The fastest and most dynamic format, where each team plays a single innings limited to 20 overs. A match typically lasts about three hours.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-runs" class="cricket"><strong>Runs</strong><br>In cricket, runs are the units of scoring, and the team with the most runs wins the match. Runs are scored primarily by batsmen hitting the ball and running between the wickets, but they can also be earned by hitting boundaries or from fielding errors by the opposing team.<br>
Scoring runs with a bat:<br>
Running between the wickets:<br> A batsman scores a run by hitting the ball and safely running to the opposite end of the pitch while their batting partner does the same. They can run multiple times on a single hit if the fielders are slow to retrieve the ball. One run is awarded for each successful exchange.<br>
Boundaries:<br> The batsman can also earn runs by hitting the ball to or over the edge of the playing field, called the boundary.<br>
Four runs:<br> Awarded when the ball is hit by the bat and reaches the boundary after bouncing.<br>
Six runs:<br> Awarded when the ball is hit and clears the boundary rope on the fly, without bouncing.<br>
Overthrows: <br>These are runs scored when a fielder throws the ball and misses the wicket, allowing the batsmen to run additional times. The runs from the overthrow are added to any runs the batsmen have already completed. For instance, a hit where the batsmen run for three runs, followed by a four-run overthrow, results in a total of seven runs. <br>
Scoring runs from extras:<br>
Extras are runs that are added to the batting team's total but are not credited to any individual batsman. They are typically given for infractions or errors by the fielding team. <br>
Wide:<br> An extra run is awarded for an illegal delivery that is bowled too far from the batter to be hit with a normal stroke. An extra ball must also be rebowled.<br>
No-ball:<br> An extra run is awarded for an illegal delivery, most commonly when the bowler oversteps the bowling crease. The batting team also gets to face an additional ball.<br>
Bye: <br>If a batter doesn't hit the ball with the bat and the ball passes the wicketkeeper, the batsmen can run. These runs are added to the team's score as "byes". If the ball travels to the boundary without being touched, four byes are awarded.<br>
Leg-bye:<br> If the ball hits the batter's body and they still run, the runs are recorded as "leg-byes." This applies only if the batter attempted to hit the ball or avoid being hit.<br>
Penalty runs:<br> Five penalty runs can be awarded to the batting team for various infractions, such as a fielder illegally tampering with the ball or the ball hitting a fielding helmet left on the ground. <br>
How to read a cricket score:<br>
A cricket score is most often displayed as Runs/Wickets (Overs), for example, 156/3 (23.4). <br>
Runs: <br>The number before the slash (156) is the total number of runs the batting team has scored.<br>
Wickets:<br> The number after the slash (3) indicates the number of batsmen that have been dismissed (gotten "out"). A team's innings ends when ten wickets have fallen.<br>
Overs:<br> The number in parentheses (23.4) shows the number of overs that have been bowled. An over consists of six legal deliveries, so 23.4 means 23 completed overs and 4 balls bowled in the current over.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-out" class="cricket"><strong>Out</strong><br>In cricket, dismissing a batsman ends their turn at bat and is known as taking a wicket. The eleven official ways to dismiss a batsman are categorized as common or rare. <br>
Common methods of dismissal:<br>
These are the most frequent ways a batsman is dismissed in top-level cricket. <br>
Bowled:<br> The bowler's delivery hits and knocks a bail off the stumps. This can happen directly or after the ball deflects off the bat or the batsman's body.<br>
Caught:<br> The batsman hits the ball with their bat (or glove holding the bat) and a fielder catches it cleanly before it touches the ground. If the wicketkeeper takes the catch, it is known as "caught behind." If the bowler takes the catch, it is called "caught and bowled".<br>
Leg Before Wicket (LBW):<br> The ball hits the batsman's body, preventing it from hitting the stumps. An LBW dismissal can be given if, in the umpire's judgment, the ball would have gone on to hit the wicket.<br>
Run Out:<br> A fielder hits the stumps with the ball before a batsman has completed a run and grounded their bat or body behind the popping crease. This can happen to either the striker or non-striker.<br>
Stumped:<br> The wicketkeeper puts down the wicket with the ball after the batsman has moved out of their crease to play a shot and missed the ball. This is a specialized type of run out where the ball is not in flight when the wicket is broken. <br>
Rare methods of dismissal:<br>
These dismissals are much less common and happen under specific circumstances. <br>
Hit Wicket:<br> A batsman is out if they accidentally dislodge a bail with their bat or body while preparing to face or play a shot, or while setting off for a run.<br>
Timed Out:<br> A new batsman is dismissed if they take more than three minutes to get to the crease and be ready to face the next delivery. Angelo Mathews of Sri Lanka was the first batsman to be given out "timed out" in an international match in 2023.<br>
Obstructing the Field:<br> The batsman is out if they willfully obstruct or distract the fielding team by word or action. This law includes what was formerly a separate dismissal called "Handled the ball".<br>
Hit the Ball Twice:<br> The striker is out if they intentionally hit the ball twice, unless the second touch is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps.<br>
Retired Out:<br> A batsman can be given out if they leave the field during their innings without the consent of the umpire and the opposing captain. A batsman who retires due to illness or injury is considered "retired not out" and can potentially return to bat later.<br> <a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-bowled" class="cricket"><strong>Bowled</strong><br>In cricket, "bowled out" means a batting team's innings has ended because all but one of their players have been dismissed. Since two batters must always be on the field, the innings concludes when the tenth batter is out. <br>
The "bowled" dismissal:<br>
"Bowled" is also a specific type of dismissal where the bowler hits the stumps with the ball and dislodges the bails. A batter can be out "bowled" if: <br>
The bowler's delivery hits the stumps directly.<br>
The ball deflects off the batter's bat or body and then hits the stumps. <br>
How a team is bowled out:<br>
To end the batting side's innings and get them "all out" or "bowled out," the fielding team must dismiss 10 of the 11 batters. Batters can be dismissed in several ways, with "bowled" being one of them: <br>
Caught:<br> A fielder catches the ball after the batter has hit it but before it touches the ground.<br>
Leg Before Wicket (LBW):<br> The ball hits the batter's body (usually the leg) when it would have otherwise gone on to hit the stumps.<br>
Run Out:<br> A batter is unable to make it back to their crease before a fielder hits the stumps with the ball.<br>
Stumped: <br>The wicketkeeper dislodges the bails when the batter is out of the crease after missing the ball.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="cricket-caught" class="cricket"><strong>Caught</strong><br>In cricket, a batter is "caught out" if they hit the ball with their bat (or a gloved hand holding the bat), and a fielder catches the ball before it touches the ground. This is the most common way for a batter to be dismissed. <br>
How a caught dismissal works:<br>
The hit:<br> The batter must strike the ball with their bat, or with their hand or glove while holding the bat.<br>
The catch: <br>A member of the fielding team which includes the bowler, fielders, and wicketkeeper must catch the ball cleanly before it bounces on the ground.<br>
A "fair catch" requires:<br>
The fielder to have complete control of the ball.<br>
No part of the fielder's body or equipment to touch or be grounded beyond the boundary line while the catch is being made.<br>
The catch to be made off a legitimate delivery, not a "no-ball".<br>
Exceptions and clarifications:<br>
Off a deflection:<br> The ball can deflect off a batter's pad onto the bat and still be a fair catch.<br>
Dropped and caught: <br>If a fielder drops the ball but another fielder catches it, the batter is still out, provided the ball has not touched the ground. <br>
Types of caught dismissals:<br>
Caught behind:<br> The wicketkeeper catches the ball after the batter hits it.<br>
Caught and bowled:<br> The bowler catches a ball that the batter has hit.<br>
Caught by a fielder:<br> Any other fielder on the pitch catches the ball.<br> 
What happens after a "caught" dismissal:<br>
The runs are void:<br> Any runs the batters may have completed during that delivery are not counted.<br>
The batter is out:<br> The dismissed batter must leave the field and is replaced by the next batter on the team.<br>
Wicket and credit: <br>The bowler is credited with the wicket, and the catching fielder is also noted in the scorebook.<br>
What if it is also bowled? If a batter hits the ball onto their own stumps (being bowled) and a fielder catches it, the "bowled" dismissal takes precedence. <br>
Niche rules and scenarios:<br>
No catch off a helmet:<br> If the ball lodges in a fielder's protective helmet, it is not considered a fair catch.<br>
Not out on a no-ball:<br> If the bowler delivers a "no-ball" and the batter is caught, they are not out.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="cricket-lbw" class="cricket"><strong>LBW</strong><br>Leg Before Wicket (LBW) is a method of dismissing a batter in cricket. The dismissal occurs when the batter blocks a bowled ball with their body, preventing it from hitting the wicket, under a specific set of rules. While the full rules are intricate, here's a simplified explanation. <br>
The basic rules:<br>
For a batter to be given out LBW, all of the following conditions must be met:<br>
The ball must be a legal delivery:<br> It cannot be a no-ball.<br>
Initial contact is with the body:<br> The ball must strike the batter's body (most commonly the leg or pad) before it hits their bat or a gloved hand holding the bat.<br>
The ball would have hit the stumps: <br>In the umpire's judgment, the ball would have gone on to hit the wickets had it not been intercepted.<br>
The fielding side must appeal:<br> The fielding team has to ask the umpire for a decision, typically by shouting "How's that?". <br>
Additional complexities:<br>
The decision is complicated by where the ball bounces, where it hits the batter, and whether the batter was playing a shot. <br>
Where the ball pitches (bounces):<br>
Pitches in line or outside off-stump: If the ball pitches in line with the stumps or on the off-side (the side the batter faces), the batter can be given out LBW.<br>
Pitches outside leg-stump: <br>If the ball pitches on the leg-side (behind the batter), it can never be an LBW dismissal, even if it was clearly going on to hit the stumps. <br>
Where the ball impacts the batter's body:<br>
Impact is in line with the stumps:<br> If the ball hits the batter's body in a direct line between the wickets, the batter can be given out, regardless of whether they played a shot.<br>
Impact is outside the off-stump:<br> The batter can still be given out LBW if the impact was outside the off-stump, but only if they made no genuine attempt to play a shot. If they did try to hit the ball, they cannot be given out. <br>
The role of technology:<br>
LBW decisions, which were historically a source of contention due to the umpire's subjective judgment, are now heavily influenced by technology. <br>
Decision Review System (DRS):<br> In professional cricket, teams can challenge an umpire's LBW decision.<br>
Hawk-Eye:<br> This ball-tracking technology shows the predicted trajectory of the ball and whether it would have hit the stumps.<br>
Umpire's Call:<br> The DRS includes an "Umpire's Call" element to account for small margins of error. If Hawk-Eye shows the ball is just clipping the stumps, the original on-field decision stands.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-run-out" class="cricket"><strong>Run-out</strong><br>A run-out is a method of dismissing a batter in cricket where a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the batter is not safely in their ground (crease). It can occur whether the batters are attempting a run or not. <br>
Key elements of a run-out:<br>
The popping crease:<br> A white line marked on the pitch in front of each set of stumps. For a batter to be safe, they must have some part of their person or bat grounded behind this line.<br>
The broken wicket:<br> The wicket is "broken" when one or both bails are removed from the stumps, or a stump is removed from the ground. The fielder can do this in two main ways:<br>
By hitting the stumps directly with the ball.<br>
By hitting the stumps with the ball held in their hand(s).<br>
Ball in play: <br>A run-out can only happen while the ball is "in play" and not "dead".<br>
The appeal:<br> The fielding side must appeal to the umpire by saying "How's that?" for the dismissal to be given. <br>
Common run-out scenarios:<br>
Attempting a run: <br>This is the most common scenario. The batters hit the ball and try to score runs by running from one end of the pitch to the other. If a fielder collects the ball and breaks the wicket before a batter reaches the safety of their crease, that batter is out.<br>
A "Mankad" dismissal:<br> The non-striking batter often leaves their crease early to get a head start on a run. A bowler can run them out by stopping their bowling action and breaking the stumps at their end before releasing the ball. This was previously considered against the "spirit of the game" but is now officially part of the run-out law.<br>
Out of the crease:<br> A batter can be run out even when not attempting a run. For example, if a batter takes a few steps out of their crease after playing a shot, an alert fielder can quickly collect the ball and break the wicket. <br>
Key distinction: <br>Run-out vs. stumping:<br>
While both involve the wicket being broken, the key difference is who performs the action. A run-out is performed by any fielder, whereas a stumping is performed by the wicket-keeper and only occurs when a batter is out of their crease and has missed the ball. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-format" class="cricket"><strong>Formats</strong><br>In professional cricket, there are three main match formats, each with distinct rules, length, and strategy: Test, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 (T20). Shorter, regional formats like The Hundred and T10 also exist. <br>
Test cricket:<br>
The oldest and longest form of the game, Test cricket is considered the ultimate test of a team's skill, stamina, and resilience.<br> 
Duration: <br>Up to five days, with each day having three sessions of play.<br>
Innings:<br> Each team has two innings to bat and bowl. The aim is to win by bowling the opposing team out in its final innings while having more runs.<br>
Attire:<br> Players traditionally wear white clothing, and a red ball is used.<br>
Results:<br> A team can win, or the match can end in a draw if a result is not reached in the allotted time.<br>
Major Tournament:<br> The ICC World Test Championship is the pinnacle tournament for this format. <br>
One Day International (ODI):<br>
ODIs are a limited-overs format that balances the tradition of Test cricket with the fast pace of T20s. <br>
Duration:<br> The match is completed in a single day, typically lasting about 7 to 8 hours.<br>
Overs:<br> Each team bats for a single innings limited to 50 overs.<br>
Attire:<br> Teams wear colored uniforms, and a white ball is used for better visibility.<br>
Play style: <br>The format requires a mix of aggressive batting and stable defense. Teams often employ strategic "powerplays" with fielding restrictions to maximize scoring.<br>
Major Tournament: <br>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the premier event for ODIs. <br>
Twenty20 (T20):<br>
T20 is the most modern and fastest-paced version of the game, designed for action-packed excitement over a shorter period. <br>
Duration:<br> Matches usually last around three hours.<br>
Overs:<br> Each team bats for a single innings limited to 20 overs.<br>
Play style:<br> Scoring is rapid, with an emphasis on power-hitting and boundaries. Bowlers use a variety of strategies to control the scoring rate.<br>
Results: <br>If a match is tied, a "Super Over" (a one-over mini-match) is played to determine the winner.<br>
Major Tournaments:<br> The ICC T20 World Cup and popular domestic leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Australia's Big Bash League (BBL) are played in this format. <br>
Other formats:<br>
In addition to the primary formats, several other types of cricket exist, including regional and unofficial variations:<br>
First-class cricket:<br> Any match played over three or more days that meets certain high standards, with Test cricket being the highest form of first-class cricket.<br>
The Hundred:<br> A domestic format in the UK where each innings is limited to 100 balls, rather than a specific number of overs.<br>
T10:<br> A rapid format with only 10 overs per side, designed for extremely quick matches.<br>
Club and informal cricket: At the amateur level, matches can have a variety of durations and rules. This includes declaration cricket, limited-overs matches, and backyard games. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-test" class="cricket"><strong>Test</strong><br>A Cricket Test match is the oldest and longest format of the sport, considered the most prestigious "test" of a team's skill and endurance. Played by the top national teams, these matches can last up to five days, with each team batting and bowling over two innings. <br>
Match structure:<br>
Duration:<br> A Test match is played over a maximum of five days, with approximately six hours of cricket scheduled each day.<br>
Innings:<br> The match consists of up to four innings in total—two for each team.<br>
Sessions and breaks:<br> Each day is divided into three sessions, separated by a 40-minute lunch break and a 20-minute tea break. The breaks allow players to rest and regroup.<br>
Attire:<br> Players traditionally wear white or off-white clothing. 
How to win:<br>
For a team to win a Test match, they must:<br>
Score more runs than the opposition.<br>
Dismiss (bowl out) the opposing team twice. <br>
The match can also end in one of three ways:<br>
Win/Loss:<br> The result if one team successfully dismisses the other twice and has the higher total score.<br>
Draw:<br> A draw is declared if the match concludes after five days and a winner has not been decided.<br>
Tie:<br> A tie is a statistically rare outcome where both teams' total scores are equal and the team batting last has been dismissed. <br>
Key concepts and rules:<br>
Overs:<br> A bowler delivers six balls in a row, which constitutes an "over". A minimum of 90 overs is typically scheduled to be bowled each day.<br>
Declaration: <br>The batting team's captain can "declare" an innings closed at any point to gain a tactical advantage.<br>
Follow-on:<br> If a team bats first and has a substantial lead over the opponent's first innings score (150+ runs in a five-day match), they can enforce a "follow-on," forcing the opponent to bat again immediately. <br>
World Test Championship:<br>
Test cricket's premier international competition is the ICC World Test Championship (WTC), which features a league format and culminates in a final between the top two teams. The first season began in 2019, and points are awarded for wins and draws, with penalties for slow over-rates.<br> 
Why is Test cricket unique?:<br>
Test matches are a severe mental and physical examination for players due to the format's long playing time and tactical depth. While shorter formats like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) have grown in popularity, Test cricket remains the game's traditional and highly respected form.<br> <a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-one-day" class="cricket"><strong>ODI</strong><br>An ODI, or One Day International, is a limited-overs cricket match played between two international teams. Each team bats for a single innings, which is currently limited to 50 overs. This format is the basis for the ICC Cricket World Cup, one of the world's most-watched sporting events. <br>
Basic rules and structure:<br>
Two teams:<br> An ODI is contested by two teams of 11 players.<br>
Innings:<br> The match consists of two innings, with one team batting and the other bowling and fielding during each innings.<br>
50 overs:<br> Each team's innings is capped at 50 overs. If the batting team is "all out" (loses 10 of its 11 wickets) before reaching 50 overs, the innings ends.<br>
Winning the match:<br> The team that bats second must score more runs than the team that batted first to win. The team bowling second can win by dismissing the opposition or by preventing them from reaching the target score within their 50 overs.<br>
Timing:<br> ODIs typically last about seven to eight hours, including a break between innings, and are played in a single day.<br>
Equipment:<br> International ODIs are played with a white ball and feature teams wearing colored uniforms, a practice introduced in the late 1970s. <br>
Fielding restrictions:<br>
To promote attacking batting, ODIs include fielding restrictions, commonly known as powerplays, which limit the number of fielders allowed outside a 30-yard circle. <br>
Overs 1 to 10 (Powerplay 1): <br>A maximum of two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle.<br>
Overs 11 to 40 (Powerplay 2): <br>A maximum of four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle.<br>
Overs 41 to 50 (Powerplay 3):<br> A maximum of five fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. <br>
Key competitions:<br>
The ODI format is featured in several major international tournaments:<br>
ICC Cricket World Cup: <br>A men's tournament held every four years.<br>
ICC Women's Cricket World Cup:<br> The women's equivalent, first held in 1973.<br>
ICC Champions Trophy:<br> A biennial tournament contested by the top-ranked ODI teams. <br>
A stepping stone between formats:<br>
The ODI format is a middle ground between the long, five-day Test matches and the fast-paced, 20-over T20 matches. This creates a distinct strategic challenge, as teams must balance an attacking mentality with defensive play over the course of a day. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-t20" class="cricket"><strong>T20</strong><br>Twenty20, or T20, is a fast-paced, shortened format of cricket in which each team bats for a single innings limited to a maximum of 20 overs. A typical T20 match is completed in about three to four hours, far shorter than the multiple days required for Test cricket. This format was created to attract wider audiences by emphasizing aggressive, high-scoring play and delivering quick results. <br>
How a T20 match works:<br>
Teams and innings: <br>A T20 match is played between two teams of 11 players. Each team gets one turn to bat and score runs, while the other team bowls and fields.<br>
Overs:<br> The key distinction of T20 is the 20-over limit for each team's innings. An "over" consists of six legal deliveries from the bowler.<br>
Scoring runs:<br> Batters can score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, or by hitting the ball to or over the boundary.<br>
A ball that hits the ground before crossing the boundary rope is an automatic 4 runs.<br>
A ball hit over the boundary on the field (without bouncing) is an automatic 6 runs.<br>
Dismissing a batter: <br>The fielding team can get a batter "out" in several ways, including knocking over the stumps with the bowled ball (bowled) or catching the ball after it is hit but before it touches the ground (caught). An innings ends when 10 batters are out or when all 20 overs have been bowled.<br>
Winning:<br> The team that scores the most runs wins the match. <br>
Unique rules and elements:<br>
T20 uses many of the traditional Laws of Cricket, but with key variations designed for a quicker game. <br>
Maximum bowling overs:<br> Each individual bowler is limited to a maximum of four overs per match.<br>
Powerplay:<br> A mandatory six-over powerplay at the start of an innings limits the number of fielders allowed outside a 30-yard circle, which encourages batters to hit aggressive shots early on.<br>
Free hit: <br>If a bowler delivers an illegal "no-ball" (e.g., by overstepping the crease), the fielding team is penalized with one or two runs, and the next delivery is a "free hit." On a free hit, a batter cannot be dismissed through a caught, bowled, or LBW (leg before wicket) dismissal.<br>
Super Over: <br>If a match ends in a tie, a "Super Over" is played to determine the winner. Each team bats for a single six-ball over, and the one with the higher score wins. <br>
Major T20 competitions:<br>
T20 is now played at both the international and domestic levels, with several prominent leagues and tournaments around the world. <br>
T20 World Cup: <br>The pinnacle of international T20 cricket, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In 2024, the tournament expanded to include 20 national teams.<br>
Indian Premier League (IPL):<br> Established in 2008, the IPL is one of the richest and most popular T20 leagues in the world. It features a high-stakes franchise model with top-tier players.<br>
Other domestic leagues: <br>Many countries host their own professional T20 leagues that attract players from around the globe, including:<br>
Big Bash League (Australia)<br>
Pakistan Super League (Pakistan)<br>
Caribbean Premier League (West Indies)<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a> </p>
<p id="cricket-field-equipment" class="cricket"><strong>Field/Equipment</strong><br>A cricket field is a large oval or circular grass field, with a central rectangular pitch that is 22 yards long. Specialized equipment is used for batting, bowling, wicket-keeping, and fielding, along with protective gear for player safety.<br>
The cricket field:<br>
The cricket field includes a large playing ground and a centrally located pitch.<br>
Pitch: <br>A rectangular strip in the middle of the ground, measuring 22 yards (20.12 meters) long and 10 feet (3.04 meters) wide.<br>
Creases: <br>Lines marked on the pitch that define a batter's safe ground.<br>
Bowling crease:<br> The line a bowler's back foot must remain behind during delivery.<br>
Popping crease:<br> The line in front of the stumps that a batter must cross to score a run or avoid a run-out.<br>
Return crease: <br>The lines a bowler must stay within during their run-up.<br>
Wickets:<br> A set of three wooden stumps topped with two small wooden bails, placed at each end of the pitch. A wicket is broken when a bail is dislodged from the stumps.<br>
Boundary: <br>A rope or marked line enclosing the field of play.<br>
Equipment for batting:<br>
Batters use specialized gear to hit the ball and protect themselves.<br>
Cricket bat:<br> A wooden bat, typically made from English or Kashmir willow, with a flat blade and cane handle. It must be no more than 38 inches long and 4.25 inches wide.<br>
Batting pads:<br> Padded guards worn on the legs to protect the knees and shins.<br>
Batting gloves:<br> Thickly padded gloves to protect the hands and fingers.<br>
Helmet:<br> Worn to protect the head and face from the ball, which can be delivered at over 90 mph.<br>
Abdominal guard ("box"):<br> A cup-shaped protector worn by male players for groin protection.<br>
Other protective gear: <br>This can include optional items such as arm guards, thigh pads, and chest guards.<br>
Equipment for bowling and fielding:<br>
Bowlers and fielders also use specific equipment for their roles.<br>
Cricket ball:<br> A hard, leather-cased ball with a circumference of about 9 inches. Balls are typically red for Test matches and white or pink for limited-overs matches.<br>
Bowling machine:<br> A machine used for practice that delivers balls at a consistent or variable pace.<br>

Fielding shoes:<br> Footwear with spikes for grip on the grass surface.<br>
Wicket-keeping equipment:<br>
The wicket-keeper requires the most protective equipment due to their position behind the stumps.<br>
Wicket-keeping gloves: <br>Larger and more heavily padded than batting gloves, with webbing between the thumb and forefinger to assist in catching.<br>
Wicket-keeping pads:<br> Specialized leg guards with extra knee protection.<br>
Helmet:<br> Worn for head protection.<br>

<p id="cricket-field" class="cricket"><strong>Field</strong><br>A cricket field consists of a large, oval-shaped grass field with a rectangular, prepared strip of ground called the pitch at its center. A boundary rope marks the perimeter, and two sets of wooden wickets are placed at opposite ends of the pitch.<br>
Field dimensions and sections:<br>
Overall shape and size:<br> The outer boundary of a cricket field can vary in size and is typically oval or circular. Most professional grounds are between 450 and 500 feet (137 to 152 m) in diameter.<br>
Boundary:<br> A rope or fence marks the outer limit of the playing area. When a batter hits the ball to or over the boundary, runs are scored automatically.<br>
Outfield:<br> The large, grassy area between the pitch and the boundary is known as the outfield.<br>
The Square:<br> An area of specially prepared grass in the center of the field where pitches are prepared for matches.<br>
The pitch:<br>
The pitch is the most crucial part of the field, where most of the action takes place. It is a rectangular strip 22 yards (20.12 m) long and 10 feet (3.05 m) wide.<br>
Wickets:<br>
Stumps: <br>At each end of the pitch, three upright wooden stakes, called stumps, are hammered into the ground.<br>
Bails:<br> Two wooden crosspieces, known as bails, sit atop grooves on the stumps. A wicket is considered broken when a bail is dislodged.<br>
Wicket ends:<br> The pitch has a "batting end" for the batter and a "bowling end" for the bowler.<br>
Pitch markings (Creases):<br>
Four white lines, or creases, are painted at each end of the pitch to help the umpires make decisions.<br>
Bowling crease:<br> A line 8 feet 8 inches long, on which the stumps are placed.<br>
Popping (batting) crease: <br>A line drawn parallel to and 4 feet in front of the bowling crease. Batters must remain within this line to avoid being run out or stumped.<br>
Return creases:<br> Lines drawn at right angles to the popping crease, which help define the bowler's legal delivery area.<br>
Fielding circles (Limited-overs cricket):<br>
In limited-overs formats, like T20s and ODIs, additional markings are used to enforce fielding restrictions.<br>
Inner fielding circle:<br> A circle with a 15-yard (14 m) radius, often marked with dots.<br>
Outer fielding circle: <br>An oval boundary created by two semi-circles with a 30-yard (27 m) radius, connected by parallel lines.<br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-pitch" class="cricket"><strong>Pitch</strong><br>A cricket pitch is the rectangular central strip of a cricket field where most of the game's action takes place. It is 22 yards (20.12 meters) long and 10 feet (3.05 meters) wide, featuring a wicket at each end. The condition and characteristics of the pitch are crucial, significantly affecting how the game unfolds. <br>
Pitch dimensions and markings:<br>
The field of play is defined by several important lines, or "creases," that guide the players' movements and help umpires make decisions. <br>
Bowling crease:<br> The line on which the stumps are placed at each end of the pitch. It is 8 feet, 8 inches (2.64 meters) long.<br>
Popping crease (batting crease):<br> A line drawn parallel to the bowling crease and 4 feet (1.22 meters) in front of it. A batter must remain behind this line to avoid being stumped or run out. Bowlers must also have part of their front foot behind this line when they bowl.<br>
Return creases: <br>These lines are perpendicular to the popping crease and run alongside the stumps. They define the area within which the bowler must deliver the ball. A bowler's back foot must land within these creases to avoid a no-ball.<br>
Wickets:<br> At each end of the pitch, a wicket consisting of three wooden stumps topped by two bails is set up. <br>
Types of pitches:<br>
Pitches are primarily made of clay-based soil and grass, and their characteristics can vary greatly based on preparation, location, and climate. Different types of pitches affect how the ball behaves after bouncing. <br>
Green pitch ("Green top"): <br>This pitch has a significant covering of grass. The moisture in the grass and the surface makes the ball move unpredictably off the seam, favoring fast and seam bowlers.<br>
Dry pitch:<br> A pitch with little grass and low moisture, which often develops cracks as a multi-day match progresses. Initially, it can be good for batting, but as the cracks and rough areas form, it becomes very difficult for batters and greatly assists spin bowlers.<br>
Dusty pitch ("Dustbowl"):<br> An extremely dry, crumbling surface that produces sharp turn for spin bowlers. These are often seen in the subcontinent and provide a significant advantage to the bowling side.<br>
Flat track ("Batting paradise"):<br> A pitch that has been rolled smooth and hard, offering minimal movement or assistance to bowlers. These are ideal for batters and often lead to high-scoring matches.<br>
Hybrid pitch:<br> A modern innovation that blends natural grass with synthetic fibers. These pitches offer greater durability and more consistent bounce for longer periods. <br>
Pitch condition and maintenance:<br>
The groundskeeper is responsible for preparing and maintaining the pitch, a process that can involve various techniques. <br>
Rolling:<br> A heavy roller is used to compact the soil, making the surface smoother and harder, which increases the pace and bounce of the ball.<br>
Covering:<br> Pitches can be covered with protective sheets to protect them from rain and dew. Keeping a pitch covered or uncovered significantly impacts its moisture level and how the ball behaves.<br>
Protected area ("Danger area"):<br> The central area of the pitch is protected from bowlers' footmarks during their follow-through. This rule prevents unfair damage to the part of the pitch where the ball usually lands, ensuring fair play. <br>
Factors that influence pitch behavior:<br>
Soil and moisture: <br>The type of soil, how well it's compacted, and its moisture content are the primary factors that determine a pitch's hardness, pace, and bounce.<br>
Weather conditions: <br>Rain, humidity, and sun can change the pitch's behavior over the course of a match, especially in longer formats like Test cricket. Dry, sunny weather causes the surface to crack, while dampness can make it "sticky".<br>
Wear and tear: <br>As a match progresses, the constant batting and bowling wear down the surface. This can create rough patches and cracks that spin bowlers can exploit to generate more turn. <br><a href="#cricket-paragraph">Return to previous page</a><br><a href="#">Return to main menu</a></p>
<p id="cricket-wicket" class="cricket"><strong>Wicket</strong><br>The main pieces of a cricket wicket are the three upright stumps and the two smaller bails that sit across the top. A "wicket" can refer to the whole structure, a single dismissal of a batsman, or the strip of pitch between the two sets of stumps. <br>
Equipment specifications:<br>
According to the Laws of Cricket, the equipment has precise measurements: <br>
Stumps:<br> Three stumps are inserted into the ground. Each must be 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall. They are typically made of wood, often ash.<br>
Bails:<br> Two wooden bails rest in grooves on top of the stumps. Each is 4.31 inches (10.95 cm) long and should not project more than 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) above the stumps.<br>
Wicket width:<br> The total width of the three stumps and two bails is 9 inches (22.86 cm). <br>
Types of wickets:<br>
Beyond the traditional wooden equipment, modern and training variants exist:<br>
Wooden stumps:<br> The classic equipment used in professional matches. They are traditionally made of ash wood.<br>
LED stumps:<br> These are an innovation used in major professional white-ball cricket. They have built-in LEDs that flash when the bails are dislodged, helping umpires with close decisions.<br>
Heavy bails:<br> Heavier wooden bails are sometimes used in windy conditions to prevent them from being blown off the stumps. Umpires may even remove the bails completely if it is too windy.<br>
Freestanding stumps:<br> Equipment made of metal or plastic often comes with a weighted base. They are used for practice on surfaces like concrete, artificial turf, or in a backyard where the stumps cannot be hammered into the ground.<br>
Training stumps:<br> For practice purposes, some brands produce single target stumps, spring-back stumps, or multi-stumps. <br>
Rules for a "broken" wicket:<br>
A batsman is out in several situations when the wicket is broken (or "put down"). This occurs when: <br>
One or both bails are removed from the stumps.<br>
A stump is struck out of the ground. <br>
The wicket can be broken by:<br>
The ball.<br>
A fielder's hand or arm holding the ball.<br>
The batsman's bat or any part of their body or clothing. <br>
Setting up a wicket:<br>
Mark the popping crease on the pitch. In a full-size match, there are two wickets, 22 yards apart.<br>
Use a mallet to drive the stumps into the ground with their tapered end. <br>Start with the middle stump in the center of the crease.<br>
Position the off and leg stumps so they are 9 inches apart and parallel to each other.<br>
Place the two bails in the grooves on top of the stumps. <br>
